Keyboard mode-switching

    A KeySym map table contains a list of KeySym values for each KeyCode. 
   Elements of this list are separeated into two groups. Group 1 contains
   the first and second KeySym, and Group 2 contains the third and fourth 
   KeySym.The selection of which Group KeySym to use when a keycode is pr-
   essed is determined by the modifier state. 
   "Switching between groups is controlled by the KeySym named MODE_SWITCH,
   by attaching that KeySym to some KeyCode and attaching that Keycode to 
   any one of the modifiers Mod1 through Mod5. This modifier is called 
   'group modifier'. For any keycode,Group 1 is used when the group modifier
   is off, and group 2 is used when group modifier is on."


   Three types of keyboard mode-switching

       Lock Down modifier
  
       if a key or key combination is bound as  a  "lock-down" modifier, it 
       serves as a "toggled key". Press it once to lock the keyboard into
       group 2, and press it the second time to unlock the keyboard.  When the
       lock-down cycle is active, the modifier state for the KeyPress events 
       will have the lock-down group modifier bit marked.  


       One Shot modifier 

       if a key or key combination is bound as  a  "one shot"  modifier ,the 
       modifier state only affects the next key pressed immediately following
       this pressed key or key combinaion. This means,only the KeyPress event
       sent for the very next key will have the modifier state marked with the
       one-shot modifier as active. You can treat one-shot modifier as a lock 
       key that unlock automatically after typing in one more key.
       

       Normal modifier

       if a key or key combination is bound as  a   "normal"  modifier , the
       modifier state affects another key pressed as active during pressing 
       this key or key combination. When once this key or key combination is
       released, the modifier state is non-active.


    How is bound a key and key combination as keyboard mode-switching ?

    Currently each keysym map is either a two-column table or four-column table.
    Within each keysym table, there are some unused entries.

    The vehicle for making the key binding dynamic is by borrowing unused 
    entries in each keysym map for mode switching. We will borrow a fixed 
    entry, which is commonly free in all keysym maps, as a pointer entry 
    into all other key binding definition entries. This is entry index 6E
    (in hex). So the key binding definition for keyboard mode switching is 
    done in keymap file. And then , it is possible to bind any key or key 
    combination to MODE-SWITCH keysym. But We have no more than two key
    combinations can be bound to the group modifier.


    Entry index 6E

    The first longword of this entry has the following format. The reamining 
    longwords of this entry are not used and have a value of zero. 

                   Byte Byte Byte Byte 
         6E(hex)    1    2    3    4    00000000 00000000 00000000 

               Byte 1 : The number of entry to key binding defiention
                    2 : Entry index to key binding definition
                    3 : Entry index to key binding definition
                    4 : Entry index to key binding definition
         

    Entry index to key binding definition

    The first longword of the entry that holds the key binding definition has
    following format. And then the second longword of this entry contains the 
    keycode values for the key combination as following format. The reamining 
    longwords of this entry are not used and have a value of zero

    Entry index   Byte Byte Byte Byte   Byte Byte Byte Byte
      ?? (hex)     1    2    3    4      1    2    3    4    00000000 00000000

          
        (first longword)
               Byte 1 : Key Binding Type ( 1=lock-down, 2=one-shot, 3=normal )
                    2 : Equivalent keycode value
                    3 : The number of key combination
                    4 : ignored

        (second longword)
               Byte 1 : 1st keycode of the 1st key combination
                    2 : 2nd keycode of the 1st key combination (optional)
                    3 : 1st keycode of the 2nd key combination 
                    4 : 2nd keycode of the 2nd key combination (optional)


    Example

    If we were to bind key combination of ALT/Space (keycode B1/D4) to an 
    unused keycode 7A (in hex) for lock-down type of mode-switching on an
    LK201 keyboard, and we chose to place the definition of the lock-down
    mode-switching modifier in keysym map entry A5 (in hex).The keysym 
    table entry for keycode 7A would have the value of MODE-SWITCH keysym,
    i.e FF7E(in hex), for each of its longwords.

         :
         6E(hex)   01A50000 00000000 00000000 00000000
         :
         7A(hex)   FF7E                                 ! MODE_SWITCH keysym.
         :
         :
         A5(hex)   017A0100 B1D40000 00000000 00000000
         :



    Soft mode-switch interface

    To allow a smart X client to instruct the server to cause the keyboard 
    mode-switching, a new function named XKMEDoKBModeSwitch is provieded by
    Server Extension.
     When the user have any key or key combination that is bound to the group
    modifier as Lock Down modifier, this function would only allow the smart 
    X client to lock down the keyboard mode-switching function or unlock it.

    Function for client (C lanauage binding)
        Status XKMEDoKBModeSwitch( display , mode ) 

        Display *display;
        int     mode;


        display 	Specifies the connection to the X server.

        mode            Specifies the mode of locking down the keyboard
		        mode-switching or unlocking it.

                        The definitions for mode-switching mode are
                       
                	       #define LockDownModeSwitch      1
                               #define UnlockModeSwitch        2


        Status

        Mode successfully switched        #define KBModeSwitchSuccess
  0 
        Mode failed to switch             #define KBModeSwitchFailure
  1   
        Invalid Mode-switch command       #define KBModeSwitchInvalidCmd  2   
        It's already in the request mode  #define KBModeSwitchNoop
