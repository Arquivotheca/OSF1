.SH Arguments
.\"
.IP \fIdpy\fR 15
Specifies the display screen on which the
Xv Server is to accept requests from Xv clients.  If the
display option is not specified, Xv uses the display screen
specified by your DISPLAY environment variable.  The display
option has the format hostname:number.  Using two colons
(::) instead of one (:) indicates that DECnet is to be used
for transport.
.IP \fIport\fR 15
Defines the port from which to get the still.
.IP \fId\fR 15
Defines the drawable into which the still is to be written.
.IP \fIgc\fR 15
Defines the graphical context.  
GC components are: 
.I subwindow-mode, 
.I clip-x-origin, 
.I clip-y-origin,
and 
.I clip-mask.
.IP \fIvx,vy,vw,vh\fR 15
Define the location and size of the video region
to be written.  \fIvx\fP and \fIvy\fP define the 
upper-left pixel of the region. \fIvw\fP and \fIvh\fP
define the width and height, in pixels, of the region.
.IP \fIdx,dy,dw,dh\fR 15
Define the location and size of the destination region into which the
still image is written.  \fIdx\fP and \fIdy\fP define the upper-left 
corner of the region. \fIdw\fP and \fIdh\fP
define the width and height, in pixels, of the region.

.SH Description
.\"
XvPutStill(3X) writes a single frame of video to a drawable.  
The position and size of the source (video) rectangle is specified by \fIvx,
vy, vw\fR, and \fIvh\fR.  The position and size of the destination (drawable)
rectangle is specified by \fIdx, dy, dw\fR, and \fIdh\fR.
.PP
Video data is clipped to the bounds of the video encoding, scaled to the
requested drawable region size (or the closest size supported) and
clipped to the bounds of the drawable.
.PP
If the port is grabbed by another client, this request is ignored, and
an XvVideoNotify event with detail XvBusy is generated for the
drawable.  If the port is not receiving a valid video signal a
VideoNotify event with detail HardError is generated for the drawable.
