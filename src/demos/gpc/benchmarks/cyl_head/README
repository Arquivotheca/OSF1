* HISTORY
*

The "3dwire" files contain a wireframe representation of the
DECstation 5000/200 system box.  The database was originally created
as part of the DECstation 5000/200 development effort using the Unigraphics
software package from McDonnell Douglas.  The data was extracted from the
Unigraphics database using a short GRIP program (the interface provided by
Unigraphics for querying the database) and written into an ASCII text format.
Awk scripts were then used to create various PLB BIF files.

The verb files were initially created using an in-house test
and demo tool used for simple motion scripting.  An awk script was used
to convert animation output into a PLB verb file.

The original Unigraphics database contains:

	 4975 lines (2 point)
	 237 dashed lines (included in above line count)
	 1171 circles
	 702 arcs
	 26 spline curves

In the BIF file, consecutive lines with common endpoints have been combined
into polylines.

All 237 dashed lines in the original Unigraphics data base are drawn as
dashed in the PLB.  In each of the above models, line style changes between
dashed and solid lines are generated only when the line style changes.
There are a total of 123 such line style changes.

Circles are drawn using the PLB "LINE3" primitive with 10 segments,

Arcs are drawn using polylines, with points every 36 degrees between the
starting and ending points.

Splines in the data base are drawn as simple polylines through the 
control points.

Statistics are as follows:
 18827 solid vectors, comprised of the following polylines:
  6107 solid polylines total
   - 3809 2-pt polylines 
   - 527 3-pt polylines 
   - 382 4-pt polylines 
   - 11 5-pt polylines 
   - 193 6-pt polylines 
   - 9 7-pt polylines 
   - 5 10-pt polylines 
   - 1171 11-pt polylines (circles)

 237 dashed vectors, comprised of the following polylines:
  158 dashed polylines total
   - 125 2-pt dashed polylines 
   - 6 3-pt dashed polylines 
   - 16 4-pt dashed polylines 
   - 3 5-pt dashed polylines 
   - 8 6-pt dashed polylines 

 123 line style changes.
 562 color changes.

Front and back clipping are enabled.  Depth queing is disabled. HLHS removal
is disabled.  Color changes only when the color changes between primitives.
