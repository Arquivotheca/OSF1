About x11perf:

Many graphics benchmarks assume that the graphics device is used to display the
output of a single fancy graphics application, and that the user gets his work
done on some other device, like a terminal.  Such benchmarks usually measure
drawing speed for lines, polygons, text, etc.

Since workstations are not used as standalone graphics engines, but as
super-terminals, x11perf measures window management performance as well as
traditional graphics performace.  x11perf includes benchmarks for the time it
takes to create and map windows (as when you start up an application); to map a
pre-existing set of windows onto the screen (as when you deiconify an
application or pop up a menu); and to rearrange windows (as when you slosh
windows to and fro trying to find the one you want).

x11perf also measures graphics performance for operations not normally used in
standalone graphics displays, but are nonetheless used frequently by X
applications.  Such operations include CopyPlane (used by the PostScript
previewer), scrolling (used in text windows), and various stipples and tiles
(used for CAD and half-toning, respectively).

x11perf DOES NOT attempt to whittle down measurements to a single ``HeXStones''
number.  We consider such numbers to be uninformative at best and misleading at
worst.  x11perf should be used to analyze particular strengths and weaknesses
of servers, and is most useful when used by a server writer who wants to
analyze and improve a server.

For repeatable results, x11perf should be run using a local connection on a
freshly-started server.  The default configuration runs each test 5 times, in
order to see if each trial takes approximately the same amount of time.
Strange glitches should be examined; if non-repeatable I chalk them up to
daemons and network traffic.  Each trial is run for 5 seconds, in order to
reduce random time differences.  The number of objects processed per second is
displayed to 3 significant digits, but you'll be lucky on most UNIX system if
the numbers are actually consistent to 2 digits.

The current program is mostly the responsibility of Joel McCormack.  It is
based upon the x11perf developed by Phil Karlton, Susan Angebranndt, and Chris
Kent, who wanted to assess performance differences between various servers.
Mary Walker, Todd Newman, and I added several tests in order to write and tune
the pmax (DECStation 3100) servers.  For a general release to the world, I've
basically rewritten x11perf to ease making comparisons between widely varying
machines, to cover most important X functionality (the notable exception being
wide lines), and to exercise graphics operations in as many different
orientations and alignments as possible.
