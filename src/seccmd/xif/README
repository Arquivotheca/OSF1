of the X-interface security commands.

There are two programs - XIsso and XSysAdmin.
Executables are included as isso/XIsso and sysadmin/XSysAdmin.
These are Motif programs for the Informaion System Security Officer and
the System Administrator. The security tasks that each performs are
defined in the Detailed Security Design Documentation, based on the
Orange Book and the Compartmented Mode Workstation Requirements (CMWREQs).

To install on a secure system
	% cp sysadmin/XSysAdmin /tcb/bin
	% cp isso/XIsso /tcb/bin
	% cp tools/redirect /tcb/lib
	% cp isso/isso.msg /usr/share/lib/sechelp/XIsso
	% cp sysadmin/sysadmin.msg /usr/share/lib/sechelp/XSysAdmin

To set the correct security attributes on the files
	% /tcb/bin/setfiles

The help messages should be installed in /usr/share/lib/sechelp/XIsso and
/usr/share/lib/sechelp/XSysAdmin

The code is split into different directories:

common        - contains code used by both programs
isso          - top level for isso code
isso/accounts - top level for all code dealing with user accounts
isso/audit    - top level for all code dealing with audit
isso/devices  - top level for all code dealing with devices
sysadmin      - top level code for system administrator

Message files need to be created before the programs will execute
correctly. For those doing internationalization work, the files *.sr
contains the source for all the messages. There is a problem in that
the code expects the same number of lines as the original which means that
you can insert spaces but cannot insert extra lines.
There are some imbedded messages inside the code but only during fail
time (i.e. program about to crash)

The compiled message files MUST be in /usr/share/lib/sechelp/XIsso/isso.msg and
/usr/share/lib/sechelp/XSysAdmin/sysadmin.msg for the programs to run.

The help files in ./usr/share/lib/sechelp/{XIsso,XSysAdmin} need to be installed.

Several functions have had to be ifdeffed OSF in the code because the current
snapshot was broken. In no order of importance they are :

	1) All calls to rewinddir have been removed because rewinddir does
	   not work.
	2) putpwent() has become a local routine because the OSF library 
	   version output a different number of fields that getpwent() read.
	3) The library routines tolower and toupper do not work therefore
	   local copies are provided.


Known bugs - 

1) The two lines underneath the menu bar are not refreshed when a menu
   item is selected.
2) On some machines the Menu Bar is invisble after a menu item is 
   selected.
3) Code does not currently use the new /etc/passwd locking scheme

Changes to be expected - 

1) The code will be reorganised to separate the screen driver portion from
   the security portion to allow character based screens to use the same code.

2) Performance improvements in the handling of the user names (current code
   is crummy), and in display of files (audit report files). Can be
   painfully slow on a non-*RAY machine.

3) The /etc/passwd locking scheme will be used
