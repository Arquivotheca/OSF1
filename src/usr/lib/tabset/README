# This README file is intended to aid Source Pool developers.  It is not
# currently intended to be installed.
#
# This README file is intended to describe the organization and contents of
# this source pool.
#
# Contents:
#	Files referenced by the termcap(4) and terminfo(4) databases to
#	clear and reset tabstops.  Generally these files clear ALL tabstops.
#	Generally these files reset tabstops to every 8 positions, starting
#	with column 9.
#
#	"tabset" files consist of terminal control sequences.  These sequences
#	are transmitted directly to the tty device.  Therefore, they are
#	data files, so cannot contain comments nor SCCS version identifiers.
#
#	Some control sequences might be misinterpreted by SCCS if the files
#	should be placed under SCCS control.  Developers should test
#	beforehand if a new tabset file can be stored by SCCS.  If not,
#	then one alternate format is uuencoded data, with a ".uu" suffix
#	intended.  The uuencoded data, however, may be subject to corruption
#	during SCCS keyword expansion, so this too should be tested.  The
#	original -r1.1 Makefile in this directory knows how to handle files\
#	ending in ".uu".
#
# Origin of files in this directory:
#	Files originally arrived from OSF in uuencoded form (.uu files).
#	Uuencoded files cannot always be placed safely under sccs control,
#	so the original .uu files were decoded.  Some of the decoded files
#	could not be placed under SCCS control, however, so those files
#	are in submitted to the ULTRIX source pool as "binaries".  Those
#	files which could be placed under SCCS control have had their
#	.uu files removed.
#
#	The following files cannot be placed under SCCS control:
#		aed512.uu	- source for aed512
#		aed512		- contains a leading ^A, which sccs will not
#				  accept
#		dtc382		- 1st line does not end in a newline
#		ibm3101		- 1st line does not end in a newline
#		stdcrt		- 1st line does not end in a newline
#		teleray		- 1st line does not end in a newline
#		xerox1720	- 1st line does not end in a newline
#		xerox1730	- 1st line does not end in a newline
#		xerox1730-lm	- 1st line does not end in a newline
#
# Format of files:
#	Files ending in ".uu" are uuencoded files, if any.  They cannot be
#	safely placed under SCCS control.
#
#	Files NOT ending in ".uu" are source terminal control sequences.
#	Most, but not all, are under SCCS control.
#
# Supported and Unsupported files:
#	Some files are Supported by Digital Equipment Corporation.  Others
#	are not.  See the "Makefile" file for further details.
#
# Modifications to files:
#	Since these files are data files, they connot contain "history"
#	information.  That history information is either below, or in the
#	"Makefile" file.
#
#
# Modification History
# ---------------------------------
# 28-May-1991   GWS
#	vt100	- for VT100 series and VT200 series terminals running
#		  in 80-column mode
#	vt100-w	- for VT100 series and VT200 series terminals running
#		  in 132-column mode
#	vt300	- added for VT300 series and VT400 series terminals.  It
#		  handles both 80-column and 132-column modes.
#
#	The files are divided up into Supported and Unsupported groups.  The
#	Supported files are DATAFILES, instead of uuencoded, since they can
#	be safely stored/retrieved to/from SCCS control.  The Unsupported
#	files were decoded from original uuencoded *.uu files.  By default,
#	only the Supported files are built and installed.  An "Unsupported"
#	build rule may be added at a future date.
