#	Digital assumes no responsibility for the use  or  reliability
#	of its software on equipment which is not supplied by Digital.
#
#	The data model is as follows:
#
#		Every system MUST have a node-specific configuration file
#		This will usually be /etc/rc.config
#		We'll call it RC_CONFIG
#
#		Every system MAY have a base configuration file - this may
#		node-specific or not
#			  This will usually be /etc/rc.config.base
#				 We'll call it RC_CONFIG_SITE
#
#		A get operation will look in RC_CONFIG first.  If it isn't
#		found it will look in RC_CONFIG_SITE.
#
#		A set operation will ALWAYS go into RC_CONFIG
#
#	RATIONALLE:
#		The base configuration file may be created and provided by
#		a mgt system.  This would reduce the required
#		configuration for a particular node.  If any changes are
#		made they are strictly local
