	Informal guide to the screend configuration file

Lexical:
	(1) Comments can either be "C-style" /* comments */
		or "csh-style" # comments

	(2) Case is significant in reserved words (all are lower-case).
		This is actually a win, because if a host name happens
		to conflict with a reserved word, you can use the
		host name in upper-case.

	(3) Host names begin with alphabetics but may contain
		digits, `-', `.', and `-'.  Ditto for network,
		subnet, and netmask names.  All can also be entered
		in dotted quad notation.  Names are bound when the
		file is read; if a (name, address) binding changes
		while the daemon is running, tough.

	(4) Numbers may be in decimal or in hex (0x0 notation).
		Octal notation is not allowed because nobody
		uses it in this context.  (Actually, hex is almost
		as useless).

	(5) Protocol names and port names (for TCP or UDP) are
		as in /etc/protocols and /etc/services, respectively.
		These can also be given as numbers (host byte order).

	(6) All white space is the same (including newlines).

General Syntax:
	(1) The configuration file consists of "rules" terminated by
		semicolons.

	(2) There are three kinds of rules:
		(a) default action specification
			There should only be one of these (the last
			one is the one that counts).
		(b) subnet mask specifications
		(c) action specifications

	(3) Rule kinds can appear in any order, but the evaluation
		order of action specifications is the order in which
		they appear in the file.
		
Syntax for default action specification:
	"default" {"accept" | "reject"} ["notify"] ["log"] ;
    Note that "default accept notify;" is legal but the "notify" is a no-op.

Syntax for subnet mask specifications:
	"for" <network> "netmask is" <maskval> ;
    The <network> is either a network name or a dotted-quad address,
    such as `36.0.0.0'.  `36' is NOT a reasonable value.
    Maskval is either a name (treated as a hostname) or a dotted-quad
    address, such as `255.255.255.0' (bits are ON where the network
    and subnet parts are.)

Syntax for action specifications:
	"from" <object> "to" <object> {"accept" | "reject"} ["notify"] ["log"]
    Says that packets flowing this way between this pair of objects
    (defined below) should either be accepted or rejected.  If "notify"
    is specified, when a packet is rejected an ICMP error message is
    returned to the source.  If "log" is specified, this packet and
    its disposition is logged.

    Conceptually, for each packet the action specification rules are
    searched in the order they appear in the configuration file, until
    one matches.  The specified action is then performed.  If no rule
    matches, the default action is performed.


Object specifications:
    This is probably most easily described in notation:

    <object> ::= <address-spec> | <port-spec> | <address-spec> <port-spec>

    <address-spec> ::= <net-spec> | <subnet-spec> | <host-spec> | "any"

    <net-spec> ::= "net" <name-or-addr> | "net-not" <name-or-addr>
    <subnet-spec> ::= "subnet" <name-or-addr> | "subnet-not" <name-or-addr>
    <host-spec> ::= "host" <name-or-addr> | "host-not" <name-or-addr>

    <name-or-addr> ::= <name> | <dotted-quad> | "any"

    <port-spec> ::= "proto" <proto-name-or-number>
			| "icmp type" <type-name-or-number>
			| "icmp type-not" <type-name-or-number>
			| "tcp port" <port-name-or-number>
			| "tcp port-not" <port-name-or-number>
			| "udp port" <port-name-or-number>
			| "udp port-not" <port-name-or-number>

    <proto-name-or-number> ::= <name> | <number>
    <type-name-or-number> ::= <name> | <number> | "any"
    <port-name-or-number> ::= <name> | <number> | "any"
    				| "reserved" | "xserver"

    Notes:
	If the protocol is not specified, "any" is assumed.
	"reserved" ports are those reserved by 4.xBSD Unix for
		privileged processes.
	"xserver" ports are those use by X server processes.
	The "-not" convention means that the object-spec matches
		if the specified field does not have the specified
		value.
	The "subnet" and "subnet-not" forms match against the
		entire address under the subnet mask.
