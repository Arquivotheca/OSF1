Changes made by Jeffrey Mogul/DECWRL, July 1992:

FDDI support
	o	new "fddi" token, basically an alias for "ether"
	o	Ultrix packet filter module (pcap-pf.c) handles FDDI
	o	print-fddi prints vanilla FDDI headers
	o	LLC packets are handled for 802.3 and FDDI
		(LLC support partly due to Matt Thomas of Digital)
	o	Some support for ISO CLNS packets (thanks to Matt Thomas)
	o	FDDI filters assume the use of encapsulated Ethernet
		packets and do not support other FDDI protocols (including
		ISO CLNS)

DECNET Phase IV support
	o	new "decnet", "lat", "moprc", and "mopdl" tokens.  Real
		support exists only for "decnet"
	o	DECNET host numbers (e.g., 10.233) supported everywhere.
		DECNET host names supported only on Ultrix systems, and
		the system must be configured to run DECNET.

BPF-in-Ultrix "latent" support
	o	Ultrix packet filter module (pcap-pf.c) contains code
		to use kernel-resident BPF interpreter, if one is available.
		(This is NOT a Digital product offering.)

NFS reply printing
	o	NFS replies are matched to preceeding requests using the
		transaction ID, which allows tcpdump to parse the reply
		packets.
