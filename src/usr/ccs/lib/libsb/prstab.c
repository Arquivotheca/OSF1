/*  prstab, fprstab  --  print list of strings
 *
 *  Usage:  prstab (table);
 *	    fprstab (file,table);
 *	char **table;
 *	FILE *file;
 *
 *  table is an array of pointers to strings, ending with a 0
 *  value.  This is the same format as "stablk" tables.
 *
 *  Prstab will attempt to print the strings in a concise format,
 *  using multiple columns if its heuristics indicate that this is
 *  desirable.
 *  Fprstab is the same, but you can specify the file instead of using
 *  stdout.
 *
 *  The heuristics are these:  assume that each column must be at
 *  least as wide as the longest string plus three blanks.  Figure
 *  out how many columns can fit on a line, and suppose that we use
 *  that many columns.  This represents the "widest" useable format.
 *  Now, see if this is too wide.  This means that there are just a
 *  few strings, and we would like them to be printed in fewer columns,
 *  with each column being a little bit longer.  The heuristic rule is
 *  that we will always use at least some minimum number of rows (8)
 *  if there are at least that many strings.
