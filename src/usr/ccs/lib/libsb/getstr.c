/*  getstr --  prompt user for a string
 *
 *  Usage:  p = getstr (prompt,defalt,answer);
 *	char *p,*prompt,*defalt,*answer;
 *
 *  Getstr prints this message:  prompt  [defalt]
 *  and accepts a line of input from the user.  This line is
 *  entered into "answer", which must be a big char array;
 *  if the user types just carriage return, then the string
 *  "defalt" is copied into answer.
 *  Value returned by getstr is just the same as answer,
 *  i.e. pointer to result string.
 *  The default value is used on error or EOF in the standard input.
