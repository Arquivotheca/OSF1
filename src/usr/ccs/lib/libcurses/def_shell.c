 * NAME:        def_shell_mode
 *
 * EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
 *
 *      Getting the baud rate is different on the two systems.
 *      In either case, a baud rate of 0 hangs up the phone.
 *      Since things are often initialized to 0, getting the phone
 *      hung up on you is a common result of an error in your program.
 *      This is not very friendly, so if the baud rate is 0, we
 *      assume we're doing a reset_xx_mode with no def_xx_mode, and
 *      just don't do anything.
