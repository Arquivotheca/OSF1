/*
 * NAME:        m_clear
 *
 * FUNCTION:
 *
 *      Ensure the screen will be cleared on next refresh.
 *
 * EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
 *
 *      mini.c contains versions of curses routines for minicurses.
 *      They work just like their non-mini counterparts but draw on
 *      std_body rather than stdscr.  This cuts down on overhead but
 *      restricts what you are allowed to do - you can't get stuff back
 *      from the screen and you can't use multiple windows or things
 *      like insert/delete line (the logical ones that affect the screen).
