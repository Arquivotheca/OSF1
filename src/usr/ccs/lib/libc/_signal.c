 * NOTES: This provides Fortran with the _signal alias entry point
 *	for the signal function.  The normal signal code is included
 *	with __SIGNAL defined which causes it to compile as _signal.
 *	This approach was taken rather than calling signal from here
 *	to make sure Fortran links with this routine.  Otherwise, a
 *	relinked program could end up calling the wrong signal!
