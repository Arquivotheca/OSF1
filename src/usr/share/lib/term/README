# Maintenance History
# -------------------
#
# 001	gws	91/06/03
#	copied from unsupported OSF/1 R1.0 sources
#	removed all the non-Digital devices
#	added lp, ln03, crt, vt100 descriptions (links to lpr)
#
# 002	gws	91/10/29
#	The "vt100" device is now linked to the "ln03" device, because VT100
#	series terminals are a lot more like LN03's than they are like dumb
#	printers.
#
# 003   gws	91/10/29
#       The man(1)/catman(1) default device "lp" is now linked to the "vt100"
#	device, so that man(1) and catman(1) will generate manpages for VT100
#	terminals
#

Here are the currently supported types of nroff devices:

lpr (default)	dumb printer with no halfline/upline, 10 pitch
crt		generic crt terminal (generally linked to the "lpr" device)
ln03		Digital Equipment Corporation LN03 ASCII printers
vt100		Digital Equipment Corporation VT100 crt terminal (linked to
		  "ln03" device)
lp		default "print" device for the man(1) and catman(1) commands
		  (generally linked to the "vt100" device (file "tabvt100"),
		  but the link can be changed by the system administrator)
