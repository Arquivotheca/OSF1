# NAME:         Terminfo source file header
#
# EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
#
#       This file describes capabilities of various terminals, as needed by
#       software such as screen editors.  It does not attempt to describe
#       printing terminals very well, nor graphics terminals.
#       See the terminfo(4) reference page for documentation.
#       Terminfo was developed from termcap.  Termcap is based on software
#       developed at U.C. Berkeley.
#
#       Conventions: The first entry is the canonical name for model or mode.
#       The last entry is verbose description.
#       Others are mnemonic synonyms for the terminal.
#
#       Terminal naming conventions:
#       Terminal names look like <manufacturer> <model> - <modes/options>
#       Certain abbreviations (e.g. c100 for concept100) are also allowed
#       for upward compatibility.  The part to the left of the dash, if a
#       dash is present, describes the particular hardware of the terminal.
#       The part to the right can be used for flags indicating special ROM's,
#       extra memory, particular terminal modes, or user preferences.
#       All names are always in lower case, for consistency in typing.
#       Because of file naming restrictions, terminal names should not contain
#       period or slash, in fact, entirely alphanumeric characters plus
#       dash are highly recommended.  These restrictions do not apply to
#       the verbose name.
#
#       The following are conventionally used flags:
#             rv      Terminal in reverse video mode (black on white)
#             2p      Has two pages of memory.  Likewise 4p, 8p, etc.
#             w       Wide - in 132 column mode.
#             pp      Has a printer port which is used.
#             na      No arrow keys - terminfo ignores arrow keys which are
#                     actually there on the terminal, so the user can use
#                     the arrow keys locally.
#             #       The number of lines on the screen.
#             s       With a status line.
#  
#	The same name should not be used for two different terminals.
#	If there is a case where the same name is used for two different
#	terminals, the last occurence of that name in a terminfo source file
#	becomes the default terminfo file for that terminal.  This is
#	because the tic(1) terminfo compiler replaces the named terminal's
#	terminfo file with a new file when the named terminal is encoutered
#	a second time.  Any previous aliases for that named terminal are
#	also replaced, because all aliases are hard links to the first
#	terminal name in a terminfo source entry.  If a site should have
#	a terminfo source file containing duplicate terminal names, the site
#	adminstrator should choose a local default, bring that terminal
#	to the back of the terminfo source file, should delete the
#	duplicate name from the other entries in the source terminfo file,
#	and then recompile the source file using the tic(1) terminfo compiler.
#	In general, terminal names should be unique.
