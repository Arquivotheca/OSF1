Specify an SID with the -r flag.
You must specify an SID when you are listed more than once in the p-file.

-2
The specified SID or your user name is not listed in the p-file.
Use the correct user name or SID number.
You may have forgotten to do a get -e or you may have supplied the wrong
SID number.The specified SID or your user name is not listed in the p-file.
Use the correct user name or SID number.
You may have forgotten to do a get -e or you may have supplied the wrong
SID number.

-4
The diff program failed when SCCS tried to create the delta.
Use local problem reporting procedures.
The program that delta uses to determine the difference between the new
delta and the previous delta failed.  The delta command did not create
the new delta.

-5
Internal software error in delta/enter().
Use local problem reporting procedures.

-6
Internal software error in delta/enter().
Use local problem reporting procedures.

-7
Internal software error in delta/enter().
Use local problem reporting procedures.

-13
The specified program failed. The system is trying again with
the specified segmentation size.
The program the delta command uses to compare SCCS files failed.
Delta divides the files it compares into segments.
If the segments are too large, delta tries to divide the files
into smaller segments. If this fails, delta terminates
processing of the SCCS file.
Key in the following for more information:
		sccshelp de17

-14
The SOH character is in the first postion of the specified line
of the specified file.
Remove this character or precede it with a \\ (backslash).
You cannot begin any line of an SCCS file with the ASCII SOH (Start of
heading) character unless you precede it with a \\ (backslash). The SOH
character has special meaning to SCCS which causes an error.

-15
There is more than one outstanding delta.
Specify the SID number that will be created.
Look at the p-file, choose the SID number of the delta to be created,
and specify it with the -r flag. Do not specify the current SID number;
specify the SID number to be created.

-16
Use the -y or the -m flag when you specify standard input.
When delta reads from standard input it does not prompt you for
comments or MR (Modification Request) numbers. You must supply comments
with the -y flag. You must use the -m flag to supply an MR number if the -v
flag has been set for the file with the admin command.

-17
The SCCS file that the delta command created may occupy a large amount
of file space. You can remove the delta just created and try again
when the system is more lightly loaded (and perhaps more work space
is available). If no subsequent delta has been made, use the following
procedure:
        1. get -k [s.file]
        2. rmdel -rSID s.file
        3. get -e -g [s.file]
        4. delta s.file
