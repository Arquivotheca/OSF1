*	Messages for SCCS rmdel-cdc commands.
*
-1
"missing -r"
You did not specify the -r keyletter when you invoked "rmdel" or "cdc".
This argument is always required.
-4
"you are neither owner nor `...'"
Either you do not own the file you are trying to process or
your login name is not the same as the one that created the delta.
Only the creator of a delta or the owner of the SCCS file can perform
an "rmdel" or "cdc" command.
-5
"not a leaf delta"
You are attempting to remove a delta which is not the
newest (most recent) delta in its branch of the
delta tree.  Only the latest may be removed.
-9
"delta specified has delivered MR"
The delta you are processing with "rmdel" or "cdc"
contains an MR number entry which has been marked
"delivered" (last character is a `*').
You are not allowed to change or remove such a delta.
-10
"bad invocation"
You invoked "rmdel" or "cdc" by some name other than "rmdel" or "cdc".
The program's execution depends on being invoked by one of these names only.
-11
"-r has no SID"
You specified the -r keyletter but did not specify the SID of the
delta to be processed.  Both are required.
-12
"being edited -- SID is in p-file"
Someone is in the process of making a delta based upon
the same delta (SID) you specified with the -r keyletter.
This is indicated by the presence of the specified SID in
an entry of the p-file for the named SCCS file.
Removal of the delta specified is prohibited because
its removal would interfere with other work in progress.
