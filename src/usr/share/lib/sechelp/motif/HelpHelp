Help on Help

This window tells you what help is available.  You can get help on keys, on 
fundamentals, and on the version.  Context-specific help is also available.  

Help on Keys gives you help on how to use keys to select options, quit the 
system, enter text, and so on.  

Help on Fundamentals explains some window basics and tells you how to select 
menus and use boxes and buttons.  

Help on Version identifies this version of the software and also contains 
release notes -- useful last-minute information that may not be in the 
documentation.  

"Help" buttons appear in each functional window.  You can select help 
whenever you see a "Help" button.  Click on the "Help" button to find out how 
the operation in your current window works.
