This selection allows you to delete an ACL synonym
from the synonym database.  The location of the
synonym database can be specified by using the
`ACLSYNDB' environment variable.  If this variable
is undefined, a file named `.acl' is searched for
in the current directory, and if not found, in your
home directory.
