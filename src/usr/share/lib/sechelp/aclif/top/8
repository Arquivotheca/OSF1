The ACL editor (aclif) maintains an area called
the ACL buffer.  The ACL buffer is used to display
and edit individual ACL entries.  This selection
allows you to define an ACL synonym from the entries
in the ACL buffer.  The location of the synonym database
can be specified by using the `ACLSYNDB' environment
variable.  If this variable is undefined, a file named
`.acl' is searched for in the current directory, and
if not found, in your home directory.  You will then
be able to use this synonym to apply ACLs to files.
