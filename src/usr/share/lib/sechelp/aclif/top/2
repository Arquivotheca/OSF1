The ACL editor (aclif) maintains an area called
the ACL buffer.  The ACL buffer is used to display
and edit individual ACL entries.  This selection
allows you to load the ACL entries that are defined
by an ACL synonym into the ACL buffer.  The location
of the synonym database can be specified by using the
`ACLSYNDB' environment variable.  If this variable is
undefined, a file named `.acl' is searched for in the
current directory, and if not found, in your home
directory.  You will then be able to display the ACLs,
change them, test access, or apply these ACLs to a file.
