The ACL editor (aclif) maintains an area called the ACL buffer.  This
selection allows you to change or add ACL entries in the ACL buffer. 
The format of an ACL entry is:

      < user.group,perm >

  user  -  user name (from /etc/passwd) that is to be controlled with this
           ACL.  The characters `@' and `*' are used to indicate owner and
           wildcard respectively.

  group -  group name (from /etc/group) that is to be controlled with this
           ACL.  The characters `@' and `*' can also be used.

  perm  -  permissions.  This can be expressed as the string "rwx",
           indicating read, write, and execute.  The character `-' can be
           used to punctuate the other permission flags, or alone to set
           null permissions.  The words `null' or `none' can also be used to
           indicate null permissions; the word `all' can be used to indicate
           all permissions. Numbers can also be used, as in chmod(1).
