The ACL editor (aclif) maintains an area called
the ACL buffer.  The ACL buffer is used to display
and edit individual ACL entries.  This selection
allows you to test file access given the ACL entries
that are defined in the ACL buffer.  You may enter
any valid user, group and file and a message will be
displayed informing you of the type of access that
the given user/group would have against the file,
using the ACL entries in the ACL buffer.
