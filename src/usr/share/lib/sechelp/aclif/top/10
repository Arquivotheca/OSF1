This selection allows you to display the names of ACL
synonyms that are in the synonym database.  The location
of the synonym database can be specified by using the
`ACLSYNDB' environment variable.  If this variable is
undefined, a file named `.acl' is searched for in the
current directory, and if not found, in your home directory.
