The ACL editor (aclif) maintains an area called
the ACL buffer.  The ACL buffer is used to display
and edit individual ACL entries.  This selection
allows you to load the ACL entries that are associated
with a file into the ACL buffer.  You will then be
able to display the ACLs, change them, test access,
or apply these ACLs to a file.
