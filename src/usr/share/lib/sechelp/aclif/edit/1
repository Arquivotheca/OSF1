This scrolling region contains the ACL entries.  The format of
an ACL entry is:

      < user.group,perm >

  user  -  user name (from /etc/passwd) that is to be controlled
           with this ACL.  The characters `@' and `*' are used to
           indicate owner and wildcard respectively.

  group -  group name (from /etc/group) that is to be controlled
           with this ACL.  The characters `@' and `*' can also be used.

  perm  -  permissions.  This can be expressed as the characters `r',
           `w', and `x', indicating read, write, and execute permissions.
           The character `-' can be used to punctuate the other permission
           flags, or alone to indicate null permissions.  The words `null'
           or `none' can also be used to indicate null permissions, while
           the word `all' can be used to indicate all permissions. Numbers
           can also be used similar to what is available with chmod(1).
