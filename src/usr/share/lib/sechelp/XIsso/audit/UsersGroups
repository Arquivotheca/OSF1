Help for Modify Audit Users/Groups

This window lets you select the users and groups that you want audited.  The 
users and groups you select for auditing can be audited for the current audit 
session, future audit sessions, or both.  

To select the users and groups that you want to audit: move the scroll bar 
until the user or group you want to select appears in the window, then click 
on the user or group to select it.  You can select as many users and groups 
as you want.  

Users and groups are dynamic auditing parameters so they can take effect in 
the current audit session.  

Your selection is highlighted and remains selected until you deselect it by 
clicking on the highlighted bar.  

By default, "Future Sessions" is selected.  Click on the "Future Sessions" 
button to deselect it.  Once you select users and groups to be audited in 
future sessions, they remain selected and apply to all future sessions until 
you deselect them.  This is true even if you exit the program and later 
return to it, or if you begin and end an audit session.  

However, this is not the case when you select a set of users and groups for 
the current session.  If you audit a set of users and groups for the current 
session, then exit the program and later return to it, no users and groups 
are highlighted.  

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up a confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.
