Help for Modify Audit Events 

This window lets you choose the events that you want to audit.  By default, 
no events are selected the first time you use the Audit subsystem.  After you 
use the system once, the events that you selected in the first session become 
the default events.  

Click on "Yes" to select an event for auditing and on "No" to not select an 
event.  The highlighted button shows the current setting.  

The events you select for auditing can be applied to the current audit 
session, to all future audit sessions, or to both.  Audit sessions are 
designed to correspond to an interval from the time the system is booted 
until it is taken down.  If the Audit subsystem is disabled while the system 
is running and then later enabled, a new session is created.  

All audit events are dynamic auditing parameters so any changes you make here 
can take effect in the current audit session.  

By default, the events you select get audited in future sessions.  If 
instead, you want to audit the selected events only for the current session, 
click on the "Future Sessions" box to deselect it and then on the "Current 
Session" box to select it.  

If you want to audit events for both the current session and for future 
sessions, select both session boxes.  

If neither session box is selected when you select "OK", the system reminds 
you that you must select at least one session box.

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up a confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.
