Help for Restore Compaction Files 

This window lets you reload audit sessions you have backed up and saved.   

The default input device is shown in the Restore Input Device box, a text 
input field.  Enter a legal pathname for a device other than the default name 
if you like.  The device must exist on your system.  If the specified device 
does not exist, the system gives you a warning message.  

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up a confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.  

Copying the files to your system may take several minutes, during which time 
you will be unable to interact with the window.  After all the files are 
copied, the system returns you to the main menubar.
