Help for Display, Print, or Delete Existing Reports 

This window lets you view a report, print a report, or remove one or more 
reports from the system.  

Report names appear in the Existing Report Names box, which contains a scroll 
bar if needed.  You can scroll to the report you want to select.  

Click on a report in the Existing Report Names box to select it.  You can 
only select one report at a time.  If you do not select a report, but try to 
display, print, or delete one, the system warns you that you must select a 
report before you can continue.  

Displaying or Printing a Report 

To display or print a report, select the report that you want to view or 
print from the Existing Report Names box.  Then click on the "Display/Print" 
box at the bottom of the window.  

The Audit subsystem displays a second window with the contents of the report 
and the name of the report at the top of the window.  Use the scroll bar to 
move through the report.  The report consists of primary statistics, start 
and end times, selected audit events, and audit records.  

To print this report, click on the "Print" box.  

Select "OK" to return to the original Display, Print, or Delete Existing 
Reports window.  Select "Cancel" to return to the main menubar.

Deleting a Report

To delete a report, first select the report you want to delete from the 
Existing Report Names box.  You can select more than one report if you like.  
When the report(s) you want to delete are selected, click on the "Delete" box 
to permanently remove the report(s) from the system.  

You are then prompted to confirm the deletion.  Select "OK" to delete the 
files and return to the Audit Subsystem Administration window.  Select 
"Cancel" to cancel the operation and return to the Display, Print, or Delete 
Existing Reports window.  When you are finished, select "Cancel" to return to 
the main menubar.
