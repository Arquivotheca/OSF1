Help for Backup/Delete Compaction Files 

This window lets you backup and delete audit compaction files.  The main box 
on this window lists all the audit sessions on the system.  For each 
compaction file, the software displays the audit session's number, the 
session's start and stop time, the number of records in the compaction file, 
and the number of bytes in the compaction file.  

To select a file, use the scroll bar to locate a file and then click on the 
file.  You must select at least one file.  If you do not, the system reminds 
you to make a selection.  You can select as many files as you like.  

You can either backup or delete the selected file(s).  

By default, "Backup" is selected for you.  When you select "Backup," the file 
remains in the system after it is backed up.  After you back up an audit 
session, you should delete that session to free up valuable disk space.  

Select "Delete" to delete an audit session when you no longer want it in the 
system.  Deleting an audit session permanently removes it, so you should only 
delete a session after you back it up or once you are sure you will not need 
it again.  

The default output device is shown in the Backup Output Device box, which is 
a text input field.  Either accept the default output device name or enter a 
legal pathname for the device name.  The device must exist on your system and 
you must have write access to the device.  Otherwise, the system gives you a 
warning message.  

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up the confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.

After you either backup or delete files, the system returns you to the 
Backup/Delete Compaction Files window.  Select "Cancel" to return to the main 
Security Officer window.
