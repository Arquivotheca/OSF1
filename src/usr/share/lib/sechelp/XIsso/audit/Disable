Help for Disable 

This window lets you stop an audit session.  Disable causes a graceful exit 
from auditing.  

Disabling audit and then re-enabling it without rebooting your system may 
cause the loss of some process data required to maintain the process state.  
If you are stopping audit to modify certain parameters, you should know that 
you can modify most Audit subsystem parameters while audit is running.  

When you select Disable, the system asks you to confirm that you want to 
disable auditing.  Select "OK" to quit auditing or "Cancel" to return to the 
main window without doing anything.
