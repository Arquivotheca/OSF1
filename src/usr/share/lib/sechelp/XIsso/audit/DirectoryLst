Help for Modify Audit Directory List 

This window lets you specify the directories to which you want the Audit 
subsystem to write compaction files.  The list of active audit directories 
is static: it can only take effect the next time you Enable (start) 
auditing.  

The audit subsystem uses two separate directories for collecting audit
data.  In single-user mode all audit data is written to the Single-User
Audit Directory.  When the system transitions to a multi-user state the
audit data is written to the first directory in the Multi-User Audit
Directory List.  This allows you to specify a directory mounted on a 
non-root file system which is mounted when transitioning to the multi-user
state.  If this directory becomes full then the audit subsystem
automatically starts writing audit data to the next directory on the list.

Multiple directories are typically used on a large system where all audit
data is stored on separate disks.  On a smaller system it is easier to
store all audit data in one directory.

These directory entries are text input fields.  Enter each directory name as 
an absolute pathname that is legal for your system.  You can enter up to 10 
different directories at one time.  If you do not enter a trailing slash (/) 
character as the last character of the path name, the software adds it for 
you.  

Use the scroll bars to access all the directory names.  Use the mouse or the 
Tab keys to move from one text input field to another.  

The directories you enter should be owned by user audit and group audit, 
set to mode 0770, and have a sensitivity level of System High.  If you enter 
a directory that is not in the system, the Audit subsystem gives you a 
message to that effect.  

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up a confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.
