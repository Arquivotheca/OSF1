Help for Unlock Terminal 

This window lets you explicitly unlock any terminal so that the terminal 
cannot be used to login to the system.  

A terminal can be locked because you locked it or because the software locked 
it.  The software locks a terminal when the terminal exceeds the maximum 
number of unsuccessful logins.  

The names of all terminals appear in the Terminals scroll box.  To select a 
terminal name from the list in the Terminals scroll box, use the scroll bar 
to locate the name you want, then click on the name.  When you select the 
name, it is highlighted and appears in the Terminal Name box.  

You can only unlock one terminal at a time.  

Type a terminal's name in the Terminal Name box if you do not want to scroll 
through the list.  Enter the name exactly as it appears in the list.  
Otherwise, the software does not recognize the name and gives you an error 
message.  

When you have typed the name or selected it from the list, unlock the 
terminal by clicking on "OK" or, if the cursor is in the Terminal Name box, 
by pressing the Enter key.  You can double-click on a terminal's name to both 
select a name and accept it.  This leaves the window just as if you had 
selected a name and clicked on "OK."  

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up a confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.
