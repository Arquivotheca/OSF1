Help for Add Removable Device

This window lets you add a removable device to the secure configuration. 
(The words "Removable Device" refer to a device with import/export 
capabilities such as a tape drive, floppy drive, card reader.  The actual
device may be internal to the system like an internal floppy drive.)

Enter the removable device name in the Removable Device Name field. 
This should be similar to the device name in the /dev directory 
(such as rfloppy0).

The Device List is a list of device names that correspond to the removable 
device name.  The device name is the physical device associated with the 
removable device.  For instance, if you have a removable device which 
operates at 6250bpi or 1200bpi you may have two different devices 
/dev/mnt-6250 and /dev/mnt-1200.  Enter these names in the Device List window.  
If you do not enter a device name then the name /dev/<removable device name> 
is assumed.
#ifdef SEC_MAC && ! SEC_ILB

You can configure the removable device to be either single-level or 
multilevel for sensitivity levels. Click on the toggle buttons to set the 
device level.
#endif /* SEC_MAC && ! SEC_ILB */
#ifdef SEC_MAC && SEC_ILB

You can configure the removable device to be either single-level or 
multilevel for sensitivity levels, and single-level or multilevel for 
information levels.  Click on the toggle buttons to set the device level.
#endif /* SEC_MAC && SEC_ILB */
#ifdef SEC_MAC

If the device is configured for a single-level sensitivity level, then
the Modify Multilevel Minimum SL and the Modify Multilevel Maximum SL
menu options are dimmed on the Modify Device cascade menu.  If the device 
is configured for multilevel sensitivity levels then the 
Modify Single-Level SL option is dimmed. 
#endif /* SEC_MAC */
#ifdef SEC_ILB

If the device is configured for multilevel information levels then the 
Modify Single-Level IL menu option on the Modify Device cascade menu 
is dimmed.
#endif /* SEC_ILB */

Click on the Enable for Import or Enable for Export buttons to enable the 
device for import and/or export.  Highlight either, both, or neither of 
these buttons to control whether information can be imported to or exported 
from the removable device.  (Highlighting neither renders the device 
unusable).

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up a confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.
