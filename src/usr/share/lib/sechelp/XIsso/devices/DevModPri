Help for Modify Printer

This window lets you modify the secure configuration of a printer.  The
printer should already have been installed using the manufacturer's
installation guide.

The Device List is a list of device names that correspond to the
printer name.  The device name is the physical device associated with the
printer.  For instance, if you have a printer which can run at 6 pages/
minute or 8 pages/minute you may have two different devices /dev/Laser1pm6
and /dev/Laser1pm8.  Enter these names in the Device List window.  If you 
do not enter a device name then the name /dev/<printer name> is assumed.
