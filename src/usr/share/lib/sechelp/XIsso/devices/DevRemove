Help for Remove Device 

This window lets you remove a device.  

The names of all devices appear in the Devices scroll box.  To select a 
device's name from the list in the Devices scroll box, use the scroll bar to 
locate the name you want, then click on the name.  When you select the name, 
it is highlighted and appears in the Device Name box.  

You can only remove one device at a time.  

Type a device's name in the Device Name box if you do not want to scroll 
through the list.  Enter the name exactly as it appears in the list.  
Otherwise, the software does not recognize the name and gives you an error 
message.  

When you have typed the name or selected it from the list, remove the device 
by clicking on "OK" or, if the cursor is in the Device Name box, by pressing 
the Enter key.  You can double-click on a device's name to both select a name 
and accept it.  This leaves the window just as if you had selected a name and 
clicked on "OK."  

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up a confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.
