This window lets you add a new group by giving the group a name and group 
ID.  Note that there is no way to delete or retire a group once it is 
created.  Any groups you create here appear in the group lists available 
through some of the other Accounts options.  

There are two text input fields on this window.  Use the mouse or the Tab and 
Shift-Tab keys to move between them.

Group Name lets you enter a name for the group.  Enter from one to eight 
characters in this text input field.  The first character must be a lowercase 
letter, and it is recommended that you use all lowercase letters.  Do not use 
a colon (:) character.  If you enter a group name that is already in use, a 
name that contains a colon, or one that does not have a lowercase letter as 
the first character, the software gives you an error message.  

Group ID lets you enter a numerical ID for the group.  By default, the next 
available group ID number appears in this text input field.  Accept the 
default or enter a number of your choice up to five digits.  Typically, group 
numbers under 100 are system groups, and groups with numbers over 100 are 
local groups.  If you enter a group ID number that is already assigned, the 
software gives you an error message.  

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up a confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.
