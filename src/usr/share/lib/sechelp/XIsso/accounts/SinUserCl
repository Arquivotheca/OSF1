Help for Single User Shell Sensitivity Level 

This window lets you set the sensitivity level of the single user shell.  

When you start to type a single user shell sensitivity level in the Single 
User Shell Sensitivity Level text input field, the "OK" button is renamed 
"Check."  You must click on the "Check" button to verify the clearance you 
enter before it can be saved.  If there is an error in the clearance, the 
text input cursor is placed at the character preceding the error.  If you are 
in typing mode, you must click on the "Check" button before you can select a 
compartment or classification from the boxes.  

To select a classification from the Classifications box, or compartments from 
the Compartments box, click on the classification or compartments you want to 
select (or on their buttons).  When you make a selection, that classification 
or compartment appears in the Single User Shell Sensitivity Level text input 
field and the button is highlighted.  Click on a highlighted button to 
deselect it.  

If a compartment has an associated minimum classification and the current 
classification is lower than the associated classification, then selecting 
the compartment also selects the associated minimum classification.  

If a classification or compartment is not valid with the current set of 
compartments, then that classification or compartment is dimmed and cannot be 
selected.  

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up a confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.
