Help for Select Name 

This window lets you select a user's name from the list in the scroll box or 
type a user's name into the text input field.  You must select an account 
name before you can modify that user's account.  All other options on the 
Modify Accounts cascade menu are dimmed if an account name has not yet been 
selected.  

The names of all users, with the exception of ISSOs, appear in the scroll 
box.  As an ISSO, you may only modify accounts that do not have the ISSO 
command authorization.  

To select a user's name from the list in the Users scroll box, use the scroll 
bar to locate the name you want, then click on the name.  When you select the 
name, it is highlighted and appears in the User Name box.  

You can select only one user's name and modify accounts for one user at a 
time.  

Type a user's name in the User Name box if you do not want to scroll through 
the list.  Enter the name exactly as it appears in the list.  Otherwise, the 
software does not recognize the name and gives you an error message.  

When you have typed the name or selected it from the list, accept the window 
by clicking on "OK" or, if the cursor is in the User Name box, by pressing 
the Enter key.  You can double-click on a user's name to both select a name 
and accept it.  This leaves the window just as if you had selected a name and 
clicked on "OK."  There is no confirmation box when you select "OK."

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  

Now that you have selected an account name, you can select any of the options 
on the Modify Accounts cascade menu to view or modify that user's account.
