Help for Set Default Subsystem Authorizations 

This window lets you set subsystem authorization defaults.  These are the 
defaults that a user has unless they are specifically set in the Modify 
Subsystem Authorizations window.  

Click on a button in the Set (for set or setting) column to select a 
subsystem authorization.  The button is now highlighted, indicating that the 
authorization to use that subsystem is now granted.  To deselect a command, 
click on the highlighted button.  

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up a confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.
