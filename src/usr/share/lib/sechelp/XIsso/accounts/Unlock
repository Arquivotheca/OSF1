Help for Unlock Account 

This window lets you explicitly unlock any user's account so that the user 
can login to the system.  

An account can be locked because you locked it or because the software locked 
it.  The software locks an account when the user exceeds the maximum number 
of unsuccessful logins or the user's password expires.  If an account is 
locked, investigate the reason.   It may be that someone attempted to guess 
the user's password and exceeded the maximum number of unsuccessful logins.  

The names of all users appear in the Users scroll box.  To select a user's 
name from the list in the Users scroll box, use the scroll bar to locate the 
name you want, then click on the name.  When you select the name, it is 
highlighted and appears in the User Name box.  

You can only unlock one user's account at a time.  

Type a user's name in the User Name box if you do not want to scroll through 
the list.  Enter the name exactly as it appears in the list.  Otherwise, the 
software does not recognize the name and gives you an error message.  

When you have typed the name or selected it from the list, unlock the account 
by clicking on "OK" or, if the cursor is in the User Name box, by pressing 
the Enter key.  You can double-click on a user's name to both select a name 
and accept it.  This leaves the window just as if you had selected a name and 
clicked on "OK."  

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up a confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.
