Help for Set Default Command Authorizations 

This window lets you set command authorization defaults.  These are the 
defaults that a user has unless they are specifically set in the Modify 
Command Authorizations window.  

Click on a button in the Set (for set or setting) column to select a command 
authorization.  The button is now highlighted, indicating that the 
authorization is granted.  To deselect a command, click on the highlighted 
button.  

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up a confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.
