Help for Set Default Kernel Authorizations 

This window lets you set default values for the kernel authorizations and 
base privileges that appear in three columns on your window.  These are the 
defaults that a user has unless they are specifically set in the Modify 
Kernel Authorizations window.  

Click on the Ker button (for kernel authorization) to select a kernel 
authorization.  Click on the Bas button (for base privilege) to select a base 
privilege.  A highlighted button indicates that the kernel authorization or 
base privilege is granted.  To rescind an authorization or privilege, click 
on the highlighted button to deselect it.  

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up a confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.
