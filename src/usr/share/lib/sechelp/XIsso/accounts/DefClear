Help for Set Default Clearance 

This window lets you select a default clearance.  This is the clearance of a 
user account unless that account is specifically set in the Modify Clearance 
window. 

Set the default clearance by typing it into the text input field or by 
selecting it from the Classifications and Compartments boxes.  

When you start typing a clearance into the Default Clearance text input 
field, the "OK" button becomes a "Check" button.  You must click on the 
"Check" button to verify the clearance before it can be saved.  If there is 
an error in the clearance, the text input cursor is placed at the character 
preceding the error.  If you are in typing mode, you must click on the 
"Check" button before you can select a compartment or classification from the 
boxes.  

To select a classification from the Classifications box, or compartments from 
the Compartments box, click on the classification or compartments you want to 
select (or on their buttons).  When you make a selection, that classification 
or compartment appears in the Default Clearance text input field and the 
button is highlighted.  Click on a highlighted button to deselect it.  

If a compartment has an associated minimum classification and the current 
classification is lower than the associated classification, then selecting 
the compartment also selects the associated minimum classification.  

If a classification or compartment is not valid with the current set of 
compartments, then that classification or compartment is dimmed and cannot be 
selected.  

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up a confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.
