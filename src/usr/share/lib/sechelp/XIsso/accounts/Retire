Help for Retire Account 

This window lets you permanently retire an account.  When an account is 
retired, it is as if that account were removed -- the account can NEVER be 
used again.  Retire an account ONLY if you are certain the account will never 
again be needed.  If you want to deny access to an account, use the Lock 
Account option on the Accounts menu. 

The names of all users appear in the Users scroll box.  To select a user's 
name from the list in the Users scroll box, use the scroll bar to locate the 
name you want, then click on the name.  When you select the name, it is 
highlighted and appears in the User Name box.  

You can only retire one user's account at a time.  

Type a user's name in the User Name box if you do not want to scroll through 
the list.  Enter the name exactly as it appears in the list.  Otherwise, the 
software does not recognize the name and gives you an error message.  

When you have typed the name or selected it from the list, retire the account 
by clicking on "OK" or, if the cursor is in the User Name box, by pressing 
the Enter key.  You can double-click on a user's name to both select a name 
and accept it.  This leaves the window just as if you had selected a name and 
clicked on "OK."  

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up a confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.
