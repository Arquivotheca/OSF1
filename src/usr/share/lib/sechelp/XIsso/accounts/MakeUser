This window lets you create a new account.  It contains text input fields 
used to define an account's characteristics.  It also contains scroll boxes 
from which you select the user's primary group and one or more secondary 
groups.  Use the mouse or the Tab and Shift-Tab keys to move between text 
input fields.  

User Name lets you select a name for the user.  Enter from one to eight 
characters.  The first character must be a lowercase letter, and it is 
recommended that you make all letters lowercase.  Do not use a colon (:) 
character.  If you enter a name that is already in use, a name that contains 
a colon, or one that does not have a lowercase letter as the first character, 
the software gives you an error message.  

User ID lets you select a numerical ID for the user.  By default, the next 
available user ID number greater than 100 appears in the User ID text input 
field.  Accept the default or enter a number of your choice.  You can enter 
up to five digits.  If you enter a user ID number that is already assigned, 
the software gives you an error message.  

Home Directory lets you assign the directory in which the user is placed when 
he or she logs onto the system.  A typical directory might be /users/sally.  
Enter the complete pathname for this directory starting with the root (/) 
directory.  Note that the directory should not already exist; the software 
creates the directory when it creates the account.  

Shell lets you assign the shell -- the program that is run when the user logs 
in.  Use the complete pathname for this program.  A typical shell assignment 
might be /bin/sh or /bin/csh.  

Comment lets you enter a comment of your choice.  This is typically the 
user's full name for identification purposes.  You cannot enter a colon (:) 
character in the Comment text input field.  

In the scroll boxes, select a group by using the scroll bar to locate the 
group of your choice and then clicking on the group.  When you select the 
group, it is highlighted. 

The two scroll boxes contain the names of all groups on the system.  In 
traditional UNIX, a user is assigned to only one group.  Select a single 
group from the Primary Group scroll box.  This is similar to assigning the 
user to a single group; you can only select one group from the Primary Group 
box.  However, you can also assign the user to any number of groups in the 
Supplementary Groups scroll box.  

To select a group other than the highlighted group in the Primary Group 
scroll box, click on the group of your choice.  Your new selection is 
highlighted, and the previous group is deselected.  In the Primary Group 
scroll box, you can deselect a group only by selecting another group.  In the 
Supplementary Groups scroll box, you can deselect a highlighted group by 
clicking on it.  

You may cancel the window at any time by selecting the "Cancel" button.  
Selecting the "OK" button brings up a confirmation box so that you can 
confirm your actions.
