The candc script is a data collection script for a tool named CANASTA (Crash 
ANAlysiS Troubleshooting Assistant). CANASTA assists in the analysis of
operating system crashes. 

This script should be invoked when the machine comes up after an operating 
system crash. The data generated by this script should be redirected to a 
file, which can be given to your Customer Support resource for the further 
analysis, cause, and a possible solution for the crash, with the help of 
CANASTA.

Following is the syntax of the command:

% /usr/field/canasta/candc crash-number crash-directory

The crash-directory is the directory in which the crash files (vmunix.ext, 
vmcore.ext, where ext is the crash-number) are located. By default, the 
crash-directory is specified as an argument to the savecore command (see the 
man page of savecore, for more details).

The output is directed to stdout. In order to save the data for the crash 
analysis, redirect the output to a file (preferably with the crash number 
as the extension, to uniquely identify the data file). It is recommended 
that this script be run in the background, to avoid the delay caused by the 
various tools that the script uses to collect the required data.

EXAMPLE:

To analyze the crash number 2 in the directory /var/adm/crash, issue the 
following command:

% /usr/field/canasta/candc 2 /var/adm/crash > canasta-data.2&

The process will execute in background, and the output will be directed to 
the file canasta-data.2.
