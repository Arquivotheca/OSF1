	 * up in favor of scrolling down.  The idea is having scrolling regions
	 * probably means we can scroll (even the whole screen) with impunity.
	 * This lets us work efficiently on simple terminals (use newline
	 * on the bottom to scroll), on any terminal without retain, and
	 * on vt100 style scrolling regions (I think).
