/*
 * Structure of the __.SYMDEF table of contents for an archive.
 * __.SYMDEF begins with a word giving the number of ranlib structures
 * which immediately follow, and then continues with a string
 * table consisting of a word giving the number of bytes of strings
 * which follow and then the strings themselves.
 * The ran_strx fields index the string table whose first byte is numbered 0.
 *
 * The last field is an integer that has three different meanings
 * depending upon its value. If ran_comsize_or_dt is greater than
 * zero, then the symbol is declared to be common of this size.
 * If it is zero, then the symbol is defined in the data section.
 * If it is -1, then the symbol is defined in the text section.
