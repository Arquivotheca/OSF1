\fBAppendix A \- Resource File Format\fP
.XE
A resource file contains text representing the default resource values for an
application or set of applications.
.LP
The format of resource files is defined by \fI\*(xL\fP and is reproduced here
for convenience only. 
.LP
The format of a resource specification is
.TS
l l .
ResourceLine	= Comment | IncludeFile | ResourceSpec | <empty line>
Comment	= ``!'' {<any character except null or newline>}
IncludeFile	= ``#'' WhiteSpace ``include'' WhiteSpace FileName WhiteSpace
FileName	= <valid filename for operating system>
ResourceSpec	= WhiteSpace ResourceName WhiteSpace ``:'' WhiteSpace Value
ResourceName	= [Binding] {Component Binding} ComponentName
Binding	= ``.'' | ``*''
WhiteSpace	= {<space> | <horizontal tab>}
Component	= ``?'' | ComponentName
ComponentName	= NameChar {NameChar}
NameChar	= ``a''-``z'' | ``A''-``Z'' | ``0''-``9'' | ``_'' | ``-''
Value	= {<any character except null or unescaped newline>}
.TE
.LP
Elements separated by vertical bar (|) are alternatives.
Curly braces ({\&.\&.\&.}) indicate zero or more repetitions
of the enclosed elements.
Square brackets ([\&.\&.\&.]) indicate that the enclosed element is optional.
Quotes (``\&.\&.\&.'') are used around literal characters.
.LP
If the last character on a line is a backslash (\\),
that line is assumed to continue on the next line.
.LP
To allow a Value to begin with whitespace,
the two-character sequence ``\\\^\fIspace\fP'' (backslash followed by space)
is recognized and replaced by a space character,
and the two-character sequence ``\\\^\fItab\fP''
(backslash followed by horizontal tab)
is recognized and replaced by a horizontal tab character.

To allow a Value to contain embedded newline characters,
the two-character sequence ``\\\^n'' is recognized and replaced by a
newline character.
To allow a Value to be broken across multiple lines in a text file,
the two-character sequence ``\\\^\fInewline\fP''
(backslash followed by newline) is
recognized and removed from the value.

To allow a Value to contain arbitrary character codes,
the four-character sequence ``\\\^\fInnn\fP'',
where each \fIn\fP is a digit character in the range of ``0''\-``7'',
is recognized and replaced with a single byte that contains
the octal value specified by the sequence.
Finally, the two-character sequence ``\\\\'' is recognized
and replaced with a single backslash.
