.H C "Introduction
.LP
This document is an extension of the \fI\s-1PEX-SI\s+1 Architecture Specification\fR.
It provides implementation specific information that will help you to 
port and customize the \s-1PEX-SI\s+1.
.LP
.H 2 "Expected Audience"
.LP
The target audiences for this document are the \fICustomizer\fR and the \fIPorter\fR.
This document will also provide assistance to users compiling on non-BSD platforms.
The Customizer and Porter audience types are defined for \s-1PEX-SI\s+1 as follows:
.LP
.nf
.ta 1.5i +1.5i
\fICustomizer\fR
.IX "User Types" "Customizer"
.RS
This person is interested in easy modifications of \s-1PEX-SI\s+1.
This may include changing implementation dependent capabilities and
parameters but does not involve changing code.
This person should read the \fIUser Guide\fR and the sections 
on customization in this document.
.RE
.LP
\fIPorter\fR
.IX "User Types" "Porter"
.RS
This person is interested in porting the \s-1SI\s+1 to specific software
and/or hardware.
This includes changing and optimizing the code for specific devices.
This person should read the \fIArchitecture Specification\fR 
and this document.
.RE
.H 2 "General Porting Concerns"
.BP
System V systems may have a problem compiling \s-1PEX-SI\s+1 because of possible
circular include references.
.H 2 "Compile Options" 
.LP
The compile options available for the \s-1PEX-ME\s+1 are the following:
.LP
.IP "\s-1PEXEXT\s+1" 28
(\s-1PEX-SI\s+1) Enables the \s-1PEX-ME\s+1.  Must be defined for
the \s-1PEX-SI\s+1 to function.
.IP "\s-1DDTEST\s+1" 28
(\s-1PEX-ME\s+1) Prints debugging and state information.
in \s-1\fL.../extensions/server/PEX/dipex/util\fR\s+1 to print debugging information.
.IP "\s-1PEX_DEFAULT_FONTPATH\s+1" 28
(\s-1PEX-ME\s+1) Defines the default path to \s-1PEX\s+1 fonts.
.IP "\s-1NDEBUG\s+1" 28
(\s-1PEX-API\s+1) Disables extra debugging code and messages.
.IP "\s-1PEX_API_SOCKET_IPC\s+1" 28
(\s-1PEX-API\s+1) Uses Unix sockets instead of System V shared memory.
.H 3 "Changing Implementation Dependent Parameters"
.LP
See the files \fL\s-1.../ddPEX/mi/include/miInfo.h\fR\s+1 
and \fL\s-1.../ddpex/mi/shared/miMisc.c\fR\s+1.
