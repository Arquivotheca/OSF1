.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET PICK IDENTIFIER\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the current pick identifier attribute,
which applies to all output primitives
which follow in the structure network.
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2,
a \s-2SET PICK IDENTIFIER\s+2 element is inserted into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer. If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the new \s-2SET PICK IDENTIFIER\s+2 element
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer. In either case, the
element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIpick_id\fP
The \fIpick identifier\fP value.
.SS Execution
When the conceptual traversal of a posted structure network
(to determine what primitive is being picked) starts,
the current pick identifier is 0.
When the \s-2SET PICK IDENTIFIER\s+2 element is traversed, the
current pick identifier is set to the element's \fIpick identifier\fP value,
and is associated with all output primitives
that follow in the structure network.
.LP
If a primitive is picked,
the pick identifier at each level in the pick path
is part of a \s-2PICK\s+2 input device's measure, and
can provide the application auxiliary information about the picked primitive.
.\" Can anyone improve the "what it's for" part?
.LP
The \fIpick identifier\fP is \fBnot\fP used to determine
which primitives are pickable;
\s-2ADD NAMES TO SET\s+2, \s-2REMOVE NAMES FROM SET\s+2, and \s-2SET PICK FILTER\s+2 perform this activity.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, STOP, *\s+2)
