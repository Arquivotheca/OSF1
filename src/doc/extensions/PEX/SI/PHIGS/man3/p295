SET CHARACTER UP VECTOR \- create a structure element to set the \fIcurrent

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET CHARACTER UP VECTOR\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the current character up vector attribute,
which determines the orientation of individual characters.  
This attribute applies to the following output primitives:  
.RS
.LP
\(bu
.SM TEXT
.LP
\(bu
.SM "TEXT 3"
.RE
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, then
a \s-2SET CHARACTER UP VECTOR\s+2 element is inserted into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer.  If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, then the new \s-2SET CHARACTER UP VECTOR\s+2
element replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer.  
In either case, the element pointer is updated to point to the new element.  
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIup_vect\fP
A pointer to the character up vector containing
\s-2TLC\s+2 values, defined as follows:
.sp .2
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pfloat	'u +\w'delta_x;		'u
.RS
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	delta_x;	\fI x coordinate \fP
	Pfloat	delta_y;	\fI y coordinate \fP
.sp .2
} Pvec;
.fi
.RE
.SS Execution
When the \s-2SET CHARACTER UP VECTOR\s+2 element is traversed, 
the current character up vector entry in the 
traversal state list is set to character up vector.  
Characters in text output primitives that follow in
the structure network will be oriented by the character up vector.  
The character base vector is defined
as a vector of arbitrary length set at a right angle to the
character up vector in the clockwise direction.  
.LP
The default character up vector is (0,1);  
the default character base vector is (1,0).  
If the character up vector 
is determined to be degenerate (in other words, has length 0), then 
the defaults are used.  
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2STOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
