.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
The \s-2FILL AREA\s+2 function puts a structure element containing
the \s-2\&2D\s+2 specification of a \s-2FILL AREA\s+2 primitive
into the currently open structure.
The \s-2FILL AREA\s+2 primitive is a closed polygonal area defined
by a series of two dimensional points in Modelling Coordinates.
The \fIz\fP coordinate is assumed to be 0.
.LP
\fBNote:\fP The \s-2FILL AREA\s+2 primitive \s-2INTERIOR\s+2 attributes
control the representation of the interior of the area defined by the
specified coordinate points. \s-2FILL AREA\s+2 does not have separate
edge attributes. See the \s-2FILL AREA SET\s+2 and \s-2FILL AREA SET 3\s+2
primitives for independent control of the edge properties.
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, the structure element created
by the \s-2FILL AREA\s+2 subroutine is inserted into the open structure
after the element pointed to by the structure's element pointer. If the edit
mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the \s-2FILL AREA\s+2 element replaces the element
pointed to by the element pointer. In either case, the element pointer is
updated to point to the new \s-2FILL AREA\s+2 element.
.LP
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIpoint_list\fP
A pointer to a list \fInum_points\fP long of Ppoint structures containing
the \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP coordinates for each point used to define
the \s-2FILL AREA\s+2 polygon.
The Ppoint_list structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Ppoint     'u +\w'num_points;     'u
.nf
typedef struct  {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_points;	/* number of Ppoints in the list */
	Ppoint	*points;	/* list of points */
.sp .2
} Ppoint_list;
.fi
.IP
Ppoint is defined as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +1i	+1i
.nf
.sp .2
typedef struct {
	Pfloat	x;	/* x coordinate */
	Pfloat	y;	/* y coordinate */
} Ppoint;
.fi
.SS Execution
When the structure is traversed, the \s-2FILL AREA\s+2 element
draws a closed polygonal area.
The appearance of the interior of the defined area is determined
by the attributes listed below. These attributes control the type of fill
(\s-2SOLID, EMPTY, HOLLOW, HATCH\s+2, and \s-2PATTERN\s+2) and the colour
with which the primitive is drawn.
.LP
The points are specified in Modelling Coordinates.
These may be any coordinate
units that are convenient to the application.
At traversal, these coordinate values are transformed
by the current Local and Global Modelling Transformations,
the View Representation selected by the \fIcurrent view index\fP,
and the Workstation Transformation current
on the workstation to which the structure is posted.
.SS Attributes Applied
The attributes listed below are used to display the
\s-2FILL AREA\s+2 primitive when the structure is traversed. The Aspect Source 
Flags (\s-2ASF\s+2s) tell where to access the output display attributes. 
These attributes can come directly from the traversal state list,
or they can be accessed indirectly, using the appropriate index 
in the traversal state list and the corresponding bundled 
representation in the PHIGS workstation state list.
