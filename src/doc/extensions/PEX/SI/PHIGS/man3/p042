.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2ERROR LOGGING\s+2 writes an error message and the
identification of the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 function detecting the error to the
\fIerror file\fP.
\s-2ERROR LOGGING\s+2 is always called by the default
\s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 function and may also be called by the application.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIerrnum\fP
The number of the error detected. The error numbers and corresponding error
messages for each function are listed with each function description in
this reference.
.IP \fIfuncnum\fP
The identification of the function which detected the error.
.IP \fIfname\fP
A pointer to the character string containing the name of the error file 
specified in the \s-2OPEN PHIGS\s+2 function.
.SS Execution
\s-2ERROR LOGGING\s+2 writes
the error number, a description of the error, and the
function number of the function that detected the error
to the error file.
.LP
\s-2ERROR LOGGING\s+2 produces error messages of the form:
