.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET VIEW INDEX\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a view index number, which selects an entry
from the workstation's view table.
The view representation selected maps primitives
from World Coordinates to Normalized Projection Coordinates.
This attribute applies to all output primitives.
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2,
a \s-2SET VIEW INDEX\s+2 element is inserted into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer. If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2,
the new \s-2SET VIEW INDEX\s+2 element
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer.
In either case, the element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIindex\fP
A \fIview index\fP for a view representation on the workstation.
.SS Execution
When the \s-2SET VIEW INDEX\s+2 element is traversed,
the `current view index' value is set to the \fIview index\fP,
which specifies an entry from the workstation's view table.
The default \fIview index\fP is 0, and
if the \fIview index\fP specified is not available on the workstation,
view index 0 will be used.
.LP
The view representation maps output primitives
from World Coordinates to Normalized Projection Coordinates by:
.RS
.IP \(bu 3n
Applying a view orientation matrix to transform the primitives to the 
Viewing Reference Coordinate system \s-2(VRC)\s+2,
.IP \(bu 3n
Applying a view mapping matrix to transform the primitives to the 
Normalized Projection Coordinate system \s-2(NPC)\s+2, and
.IP \(bu 3n
Optionally clipping the primitives to specified clipping limits in 
\s-2NPC\s+2 according to separate clipping indicators for the
\fIx, y\fP, and \fIz\fP dimensions.
.RE
.LP
A view representation is set using
\s-2SET VIEW REPRESENTATION\s+2 or \s-2SET VIEW REPRESENTATION 3\s+2.
See the descriptions of these functions for more information on the
representations and their default values.
.LP
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state \s-2(PHOP, *, STOP, *)\s+2
.IP 114
Ignoring function, the view index value is less than zero
