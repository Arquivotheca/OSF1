.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE VIEW FACILITIES\s+2 to determine the
number of predefined view representations
supported by a specified workstation type.
.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fItype\fP
\fIWorkstation type\fP being queried.
.br
.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fInum\fP
An pointer to a location in which the system returns
the number of predefined view indices for the workstation.
.
.SS Execution
.LP
If the inquired information is available, the error indicator is returned
as zero and values are returned in the output parameters.
.LP
If the inquired information is not available, the values returned in the
output parameters are undefined and the error indicator is
set to one of the below error numbers to indicate the reason for
nonavailability.
.LP
Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not invoked
when an error is detected by this function.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, *\s+2)
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 051
