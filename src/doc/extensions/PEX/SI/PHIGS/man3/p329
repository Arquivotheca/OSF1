.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET INTERIOR INDEX\s+2 creates a structure element
containing an interior index number, which selects an entry
from the workstation's interior bundle table.
This attribute applies to the output primitives

.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIindex\fP
An \fIinterior index\fP for an interior representation on the workstation.
.SS Execution
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2,
a \s-2SET INTERIOR INDEX\s+2 element is inserted into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer. If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2,
the new \s-2SET INTERIOR INDEX\s+2 element
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer.
In either case, the element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.LP
When the \s-2SET INTERIOR INDEX\s+2 element is traversed,
the current interior index value is set to the \fIinterior index\fP,
which specifies an entry from the workstation's interior bundle table.
The default \fIinterior index\fP is 1, and
if the \fIinterior index\fP specified is not available on the workstation,
1 will be used.
.LP
An interior representation contains values for the following attributes:
.sp .2
.nf
.RS
\(bu  interior style
\(bu  interior style index
\(bu  interior colour index
.\"PHIGS+:	\(bu  interior lighting meth
.\"PHIGS+:	\(bu  interior shading meth
.fi
.RE
.LP
Area-defining output primitives which follow in the structure network
will use the values from the specified representation
for those interior attributes whose Aspect Source Flag (\s-2ASF\s+2) is set to
\s-2BUNDLED\s+2.
When the \s-2ASF\s+2s are
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2 ,
the attributes come from the appropriate
\s-2SET\s+2
attribute
elements.
.LP
Interior representations are defined with
\s-2SET INTERIOR REPRESENTATION\s+2.
.\"PHIGS+:	or \s-2SET INTERIOR REPRESENTATION PLUS\s+2.
.\"PHIGS+:	If your application does not use lighting or
.\"PHIGS+:	shading, use \s-2SET INTERIOR REPRESENTATION\s+2 to define values for the
.\"PHIGS+:	interior style, interior style index, and interior colour index attributes.
.\"PHIGS+:	If you application uses lighting and shading, use \s-2SET INTERIOR
.\"PHIGS+:	REPRESENTATION PLUS\s+2 to define all the interior representation attributes
.\"PHIGS+:	including interior lighting method and interior shading method.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2STOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 100
Ignoring function, the bundle index value is less than one
