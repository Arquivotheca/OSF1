.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET LOCAL TRANSFORMATION\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a \s-2\&2D\s+2 local modelling transformation matrix
and a composition type,
allowing various objects in the image to be defined
in various convenient modelling coordinate systems.
.LP
During traversal, the element will modify the \fIcurrent local
modelling transformation\fP according to the composition type.
Then the modified local modelling transformation is composed with the current
global modelling transformation to create a new composite modelling
transformation. The composite modelling transformation then maps the modelling
coordinates \s-2(MC)\s+2 used to define individual output primitives
to a unified world coordinate \s-2(WC)\s+2 space.
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2,
the \s-2SET LOCAL TRANSFORMATION\s+2 element
is inserted into the open structure after the element pointed to
by the current element pointer. If the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the
\s-2SET LOCAL TRANSFORMATION\s+2
element replaces the element pointed to by the
element pointer. In either case, the element pointer is updated to point
to the new element.

.SS Execution
.LP
When traversal of a structure begins,
the initial current local modelling transformation \s-2(L)\s+2 and
the current global modelling transformation \s-2(G)\s+2
are both the \s-2\&3D\s+2, 4 \(mu 4 identity matrix.
.\"	A Composite Modelling Transformation \s-2(C)\s+2 is by
.\"	definition G \(mu L\(aa at all times.
The composite modelling transformation \s-2(C)\s+2 within a structure traversal
is formed by the matrix multiplication of the
current local modelling transformation \s-2(L)\s+2 and the
current global modelling transformation \s-2(G)\s+2 as follows:
.IP
C \(<- G \(mu L
.LP
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 assumes representation of points as column vectors.  Hence, the order
of composition in C \(<- G \(mu L (and throughout) is ``post-concatenation''
or ``post-multiply.''
.LP
When a new structure is traversed, one step in the
invocation of the referenced structure is to save the current modelling
transformations (\s-2L, G\s+2, and \s-2C\s+2).  The child structure inherits the parent's
composite modelling transformation \s-2(C)\s+2
as its current global modelling transformation \s-2(G)\s+2, and
an identity matrix as its initial
current local modelling transformation \s-2(L)\s+2.
The parent and child have equal composite modelling transformations \s-2(C)\s+2,
because \s-2L\s+2 is the identity.  After traversal of the child structure network,
the saved transformations are restored so that the parent is unaffected
by the execution of a child.
.LP
When the \s-2SET LOCAL TRANSFORMATION\s+2 element is traversed,
first the element's \fItransformation matrix\fP is expanded to the \s-2\&3D\s+2
equivalent \fItransformation matrix\fP \s-2(T)\s+2.
Then the \fIcompose type\fP specifies the role of the
current local modelling transformation \s-2(L)\s+2
in composing the new value for the
current local modelling transformation (L\(aa),
which is then combined with the current global modelling transformation \s-2(G)\s+2
to calculate the new composite modelling transformation \s-2(C)\s+2.
.IP \fIPreconcatenate\fP
The \fItransformation matrix\fP \s-2(T)\s+2 is multiplied by the
current local modelling transformation \s-2(L)\s+2:
.IP
L\(aa \(<- L \(mu T
.IP
C \(<- G \(mu L\(aa
.IP \fIPostconcatenate\fP
The current local modelling transformation \s-2(L)\s+2 is multiplied by the
\fItransformation matrix\fP \s-2(T)\s+2:
.IP
L\(aa \(<- T \(mu L
.IP
C \(<- G \(mu L\(aa
.IP \fIReplace\fP
The \fItransformation matrix\fP \s-2(T)\s+2 replaces the value of
current local modelling transformation \s-2(L)\s+2.
.IP
L\(aa \(<- T
.IP
C \(<- G \(mu L\(aa
.LP
The current composite modelling transformation maps the
modelling coordinates, used to define individual output primitives, to
world coordinates.
Mapping the primitives to the world coordinate space establishes the
relation between different objects of the image by redefining the parts in
terms of a unified coordinate space. This allows the application to define
different parts of the image in different local modelling coordinates
convenient to the objects being defined, and then to apply
transformations that will map the local coordinate systems of each part to
a single world coordinate \s-2(WC)\s+2 space.
Finally, the viewing mechanism maps \s-2WC\s+2 to device coordinates
on the workstation's physical display surface.
