.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
.LP
\s-2RESTORE MODELLING CLIPPING VOLUME\s+2
creates a structure element
to restore the modelling clipping volume, undoing
the effect of \s-2SET MODELLING CLIPPING VOLUME\s+2 and
\s-2SET MODELLING CLIPPING VOLUME 3\s+2 elements in this structure.
.SS Execution
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, a
\s-2RESTORE MODELLING CLIPPING VOLUME\s+2 element is inserted
into the currently open structure after
the element pointed to by the current element pointer.  If the edit
mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the new element replaces the element pointed to by
the element pointer.  In either case, the element pointer is
updated to point to the new \s-2RESTORE MODELLING CLIPPING VOLUME\s+2
element.
.LP   
During traversal, a \s-2RESTORE MODELLING CLIPPING VOLUME\s+2 element resets
the current modelling clipping volume to the value of that attribute
inherited by the structure being traversed.  The attribute may have
been modified by traversal of \s-2SET MODELLING CLIPPING VOLUME\s+2 and/or
\s-2SET MODELLING CLIPPING VOLUME 3\s+2 elements.
.LP    
Modelling clipping to the volume controlled by these three elements
is enabled and disabled by \s-2SET MODELLING CLIPPING INDICATOR\s+2.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, STOP, *\s+2)
