.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2REQUEST PICK\s+2 to request an operator interaction with a
specified pick device. The device must be in request mode. See
\s-2SET PICK MODE\s+2 and \s-2INITIALIZE PICK\s+2 for more information.
See the \fIAvailable Devices\fP section of \s-2INITIALIZE PICK\s+2 for a
description of the available pick devices.
.LP
The request suspends \s-2PHIGS\s+2 until the
specified device is triggered,
or the operator performs a \*b.
A \*b is performed by typing the \s-2CONTROL\s+2 and \s-2D\s+2 keys
simultaneously (^D).
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
Workstation identifier. An integer specifying the workstation with which
the requested pick device is associated.
.IP \fIdev\fP
The device number of the requested pick device.
.IP \fIdepth\fP
The maximum depth of the pick path to return.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIin_status\fP
A pointer to the location to store the status of the request.
Pin_status is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.nf
.ta .5i
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PIN_STATUS_NONE,
	PIN_STATUS_OK,
	PIN_STATUS_NO_IN
.sp .2
} Pin_status;
.sp .4
.IP \fIrpick\fP
A pointer to a Ppick_path structure in which the system stores the pick path.
Ppick_path is defined in phigs.h as:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Ppick_path_elem     'u +\w'path_list;     'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	depth;	/* pick path depth */
	Ppick_path_elem	*path_list;	/* pick path list */
.sp .2
} Ppick_path;
.fi
.IP
\fIdepth\fP indicates the number of elements in the measure's path.  
This is the depth value contained in the device's current measure.  
It is not affected by the \fImaximum depth to return\fP parameter.  
Thus, the number of elements returned in \fIpath_list\fP may be less than
\fIdepth\fP.  
.IP
\fIpath_list\fP is the array of path elements defining
the location of the picked primitive in the Central Structure Store 
(\s-2CSS\s+2). \fBThis array must be allocated by the calling program
and the array pointer assigned to this field before calling this function\fP.  
The array must be at least of length \fImaximum depth to return\fP.
Ppick_path_elem is defined in phigs.h as:
.bp
.sp .4
.ta .5i +1i  +1i
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	struct_id;	/* structure identifier */
	Pint	pick_id;	/* pick identifier */
	Pint	elem_pos;	/* element number */
.sp .2
} Ppick_path_elem;
.fi
.IP
\fIstruct_id\fP, \fIpick_id\fP, and \fIelem_pos\fP
are the structure identifier, pick identifier,
and element number, respectively, of each element in the path.
.SS Execution
\s-2REQUEST PICK\s+2 requests a logical input value from the specified
pick device. The specified device must be in request mode. See
\s-2SET PICK MODE\s+2 for more information.
.LP
\s-2REQUEST PICK\s+2 creates a measure
process for the specified device and suspends \s-2PHIGS\s+2 until the
device is triggered or the operator issues a \*b. 
A \*b is generated by the operator by depressing the
\s-2CONTROL\s+2 and \s-2D\s+2 keys
simultaneously (^D).
.LP
If the pick device is triggered and a pick has not been made, the status
is returned as \s-2PIN_STATUS_NONE\s+2, and no pick data is returned.
If the pick device is triggered and a pick has been made, the status
is returned as \s-2PIN_STATUS_OK\s+2, and the pick data is available in the output
parameters.
If a \*b occurs, the status is returned as \s-2PIN_STATUS_NO_IN\s+2, and no pick
value is returned.
.LP
In all cases, when the device is triggered or a \*b is issued, the
current measure process is terminated and \s-2PHIGS\s+2 processing resumes.
.LP
See \s-2INITIALIZE PICK 3\s+2 for a description of the available
\s-2PICK\s+2 devices and how their measure values are determined.
