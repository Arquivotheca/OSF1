.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
The
\s-2POLYLINE\s+2
function places a structure element containing
the full specification of a \s-2\&2D\s+2 polyline into the currently open structure,
according to the current edit mode.
A \s-2\&2D\s+2 polyline primitive is a set of connected straight lines in two dimensions,
\fIx\fP and \fIy\fP.
The \fIz\fP coordinate is assumed to be 0. The polyline is defined
by a series of points in Modelling Coordinates (\s-2MC\s+2). A polyline may be closed
or self-intersecting.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIpoint_list\fP
A pointer to a Ppoint_list structure containing a list of Ppoint structures,
which contain the \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP coordinates for each point.
At least two points must be specified; a polyline structure element that has
fewer than two points will be treated in a workstation-dependent fashion.
.IP
The Ppoint_list structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Ppoint	'u +\w'num_points;     'u
.nf
typedef struct  {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_points;	/* number of Ppoints in the list */
	Ppoint	*points;	/* list of points */
.sp .2
} Ppoint_list;
.sp .4
.fi
The \fInum_points\fR component specifies the number of elements in the list.
The \fIpoints\fR component is a pointer to a list of Ppoints \fInum_points\fR long.
The Ppoint structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pfloat     'u +\w'x;     'u
.nf
typedef struct  {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	x;	/* x coordinate */
	Pfloat	y;	/* y coordinate */
.sp .2
} Ppoint;
.fi
.SS Execution
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, the \s-2POLYLINE\s+2 element
is inserted into the open structure after the element pointed to by the
element pointer. If the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the \s-2POLYLINE\s+2
element replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer. In either
case, the element pointer is updated to point to the new \s-2POLYLINE\s+2
element.
.LP
When the structure is traversed, the polyline element draws straight
lines between the points specified, beginning with the first point
and ending with the last. The current values of the attributes listed
below will be applied to the polyline when it is drawn.
.LP
The coordinates used to specify the polyline primitive are \s-2MC\s+2.
These may be any coordinate units that are convenient to the
application. At traversal, these coordinate values are transformed by
the current local and global modelling transformations,
the view representation selected by the \fIcurrent view index\fP,
and the workstation transformation current on the
workstation to which the structure is posted.
.SS Attributes Applied
The attributes listed below are used to display the
\s-2POLYLINE\s+2 primitive when the structure is traversed. The Aspect Source
Flags (\s-2ASF\s+2s) tell where to access the output display attributes.
These attributes can come directly from the traversal state list,
or they can be accessed indirectly, using the appropriate index
in the traversal state list and the corresponding bundled
representation in the PHIGS workstation state list.
