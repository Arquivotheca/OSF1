.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE COLOUR MODEL FACILITIES\s+2 to obtain a list of the
colour model facilities for the specified type of workstation
from the workstation description table.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fItype\fP
Get the colour model facilities for this workstation type.
.IP \fIlength\fP
The number of elements for which memory is allocated in the output
parameter \fImodels\fR.
Zero may be specified in order to get the \fItotal_length\fP of the list.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position in the list at which to begin the inquiry.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fImodels\fP
A pointer to a Pint_list
which returns the portion of the
list of available colour models from the
workstation description table, starting with \fIstart\fP.
Pint_list is defined in phigs.h as:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'num_ints;     'u
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	 num_ints;	/* number of integers */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of integers */
.fi
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.sp
The pointer to the list of integers must be initialized to an array of
\fIlength\fP Pint elements.
.IP \fItotal_length\fP
A pointer to an integer in which to return the total length of
the list.
This is the value required for \fIlength\fP if all the items in the
list are to be returned.
.IP \fIdef\fP
A pointer to an integer in which to return the default colour model\fP.
Possible colour models are as follows:
.ta .5i +.5i
.nf
	0	\s-2PINDIRECT\s+2
	1	\s-2PMODEL_RGB\s+2
	2	\s-2PMODEL_CIELUV\s+2
	3	\s-2PMODEL_HSV\s+2
	4	\s-2PMODEL_HLS\s+2

.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, *\s+2)
.IP 051
Ignoring function, this information is not yet available
for this workstation type; open a workstation of this type
and use the specific workstation type
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have
output capability (that is, the workstation category is neither 
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 062
Ignoring function, this information is not available for this
\s-2MO\s+2 workstation type
