.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE WORKSTATION CLASSIFICATION\s+2 to determine the classification of a specified workstation type.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fItype \fP
Type of workstation.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIclass\fP
A pointer to a Pws_class enumerated variable in which the system returns the 
workstation class. 
Values for Pws_class are defined in phigs.h as follows:
.ta .5i +1.25i
.nf
.sp .4
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PCLASS_VEC,	/* Vector Device */
	PCLASS_RASTER,	/* Raster Device */
	PCLASS_OTHER	/* Other Device */
.sp .2
} Pws_class;
.fi
.SS Execution
.LP
If the inquired information is available, the error indicator is returned
as zero and values are returned in the output parameters.
.LP
If the inquired information is not available, the values returned in the
output parameters are undefined and the error indicator is
set to one of the below error numbers to indicate the reason for
nonavailability.
.LP
Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not invoked
when an error is detected by this function.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, *\s+2)
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 051
Ignoring function, this information is not yet available
for this workstation type; open a workstation of this type
and use the specific workstation type
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(i.e., the workstation category is neither \s-2OUTPUT\s+2,
\s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2) 
.IP 062
Ignoring function, this information is not available for this
\s-2MO\s+2 workstation type
