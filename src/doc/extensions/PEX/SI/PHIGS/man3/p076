.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2INITIALIZE CHOICE 3\s+2 sets the initialization parameters of a
\s-2CHOICE\s+2 device.
This function stores these parameters in the workstation state list
of the workstation associated with the specified device.
The specified \fBdevice must be in \s-2REQUEST\s+2 mode\fP when this
function is called.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The workstation identifier of the workstation associated with the device.
.IP \fIdev\fP
The device number of the \s-2CHOICE\s+2 device to initialize.
See the \fIAvailable Devices\fP section below for a description of the
available devices.
.IP \fIistat\fP
The \s-2CHOICE\s+2 status of the initial measure.
Pin_status is an enumerated data type defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i
.nf
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PIN_STATUS_NONE,
	PIN_STATUS_OK,
	PIN_STATUS_NO_IN
.sp .2
} Pin_status;
.fi
.IP \fIinit\fP
The initial choice number.  \s-2PHIGS\s+2 ignores this value if \fIistat\fP
is not \s-2PIN_STATUS_OK\s+2.
.IP \fIpet\fP
The prompt/echo type desired.
Those supported by each device are listed in the
\fIAvailable Devices\fP section below.
.IP \fIecho_volume\fP
A pointer to a Plimit3 structure defining the
\fIx\fP, \fIy\fP, and \fIz\fP
components of the echo volume, in Device Coordinates.
Plimit3 is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +1i  +1i
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	x_min;	/* minimum x coordinate value */
	Pfloat	x_max;	/* maximum x coordinate value */
	Pfloat	y_min;	/* minimum y coordinate value */
	Pfloat	y_max;	/* maximum y coordinate value */
	Pfloat	z_min;	/* minimum z coordinate value */
	Pfloat	z_max;	/* maximum z coordinate value */
.sp .2
} Plimit3;
.fi
.IP \fIrecord\fP
A pointer to a Pchoice_data3 union containing the data record information.
The contents of the data record for each device and prompt/echo type are
described below in the \fIAvailable Devices\fP section.
.IP
The members of the data record union correspond to the prompt/echo type
being used.
As an example, the appropriate member of the Pchoice_data3 union for
prompt/echo type 1 is
\fIpet_r1\fP.
.IP
For some prompt/echo types the data record is not used.
The \fIrecord\fP parameter, however, must still be supplied.
.IP
Pchoice_data3 is defined in phigs.h as:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Ppr_switch     'u +\w'num_strings;     'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
      union {
	struct {
	   Pint	unused;
	} pet_r1;
	struct {
	   Pint	num_prompts;	/* number of alternatives	*/
	   Ppr_switch	*prompts;	/* array of prompts		*/
	} pet_r2;
	struct {
	   Pint	num_strings;	/* number of choice strings	*/
	   char	**strings;	/* array of choice strings	*/
	} pet_r3;
	struct {
	   Pint	num_strings;	/* number of alternatives	*/
	   char	**strings;	/* array of strings		*/
	} pet_r4;
	struct {
	   Pint	struct_id;	/* struct identifier		*/
	   Pint	num_pick_ids;	/* number of alternatives	*/
	   Pint	*pick_ids;	/* array of pick identifiers	*/
	} pet_r5;

.SS Execution
.LP
\s-2INITIALIZE CHOICE 3\s+2 sets the initialization parameters of a
\s-2CHOICE\s+2 device.
This function stores these parameters in the workstation state list
of the workstation associated with the specified device.
The specified device must be in \s-2REQUEST\s+2 mode when this
function is called.
.LP
The parameters that are initialized by this function are 
\fIinitial choice\fP,
\fIprompt/echo type\fP,
\fIecho volume\fP,
and
\fIinput data record\fP.
.LP
The \fIinitial choice\fP is the logical input value the device will be
set to whenever it is enabled.
The device's measure retains this value until operator input changes it.
A device is enabled when the appropriate \s-2REQUEST\s+2 function is called,
or when its input mode is set to \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 or \s-2EVENT\s+2.
.LP
A \s-2CHOICE\s+2 device measure consists of a \fIstatus\fP and a
\fIchoice number\fP.
\fIStatus\fP indicates whether or not one of the possible choice values
on the device was selected.
(It is possible to trigger some \s-2CHOICE\s+2 devices without selecting one
of the choices.)
The \fIchoice number\fP indicates the value selected, if any.
.LP
The \fIprompt/echo type\fP determines how the device will be presented to
the operator and respond to his actions.
Each device supports one or more prompt/echo types.
Those supported by each device are listed in the device's
description in the \fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section below.
All devices support prompt/echo type 1.
Positive prompt/echo types are defined by the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 standard.
Negative types are implementation-dependent.
.LP
The \fIecho volume\fP defines the region of the display surface in which to
echo the device.
It is specified in Device Coordinates (\s-2DC\s+2).
Devices that use the echo volume may restrict their display to this
region.
Some of these devices may still recognize operator input
outside the region even though they don't display there.
.LP
The \fIinput data record\fP contains the prompt/echo type specific
information that controls the device's appearance and characteristics.
Not all of the data record contents are used by some devices.
The device descriptions in the \fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section below
list the data record contents that each device recognizes.
.LP
All the initialization parameters must be specified properly or this function
will generate an error.
The \fIERRORS\fP section below lists the possible error conditions.
.LP
The default initialization parameters and the list of prompt/echo types
supported by a \s-2CHOICE\s+2 input device can be inquired with the function
\s-2INQUIRE DEFAULT CHOICE DEVICE DATA 3\s+2.
The current state of the device can be inquired with the function
\s-2INQUIRE CHOICE DEVICE STATE 3\fP.
.SH AVAILABLE DEVICES
.SS Device 1 - "Athena List Widget"
.LP
This device is a collection of widgets from the Athena widget set.
The set consists of a shell widget, a viewport widget, and a list widget. The
list is the item manipulated by the operator to change the choice value.
.LP
The echo volume is not used by this device.
