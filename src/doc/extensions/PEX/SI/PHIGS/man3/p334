.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET INTERIOR STYLE INDEX\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the current interior style index attribute.
.LP
When the current interior style index
\s-2ASF\s+2 is set to \s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2, the current value of
this attribute applies to the following output primitives:

If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2,
a \s-2SET INTERIOR STYLE INDEX\s+2 element is inserted into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer. If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2,
the new \s-2SET INTERIOR STYLE INDEX\s+2 element
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer.
In either case, the
element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIindex\fP
The interior style index, which selects from the workstation's
\s-2PATTERN\s+2 or \s-2HATCH\s+2.
.SS Execution
When the \s-2SET INTERIOR STYLE INDEX\s+2 element is traversed, the
current interior style index
entry in the traversal state list is set to the
interior style index.  The default interior style index is 1.
.LP
When the current interior style index \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2, filled area output primitives that follow in
the structure network are filled using the interior style index specified.  
If the interior style index specified is not available on the workstation, 
\s-2HATCH\s+2 -1 (or \s-2GENERAL INTERIOR\s+2 1) is used.
.LP
When the interior style (either individual or bundled, depending on
the interior style \s-2ASF\s+2) is \fIHollow\fP, \fISolid\fP, or \fIEmpty\fP,
the interior style index does not apply.
When the interior style is \fIPatterned\fP, the interior style index
determines which of the workstation's pattern table entries is used;
the interior style index may be called the pattern index in this case.
When the interior style is \fIHatched\fP, the interior style index
determines which of the workstation's predefined hatches is used;
the interior style index may be called the hatch index in this case.
.LP
When the current interior style index \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to \s-2BUNDLED\s+2,
the interior style index is taken from the
workstation representation indicated by the current interior index.
In this case, the interior style index
set with \s-2SET INTERIOR STYLE INDEX\s+2 has no effect.
