.SH NAME
SET TEXT INDEX \- create a structure element containing a text representation index attribute
.IX "Text Attributes" "SET TEXT INDEX"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS C Syntax

Pint	index;	\fItext index\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET TEXT INDEX\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a text index number, which selects an entry
from the workstation's text bundle table.
This attribute applies to the output primitives:
.RS
.nf
\(bu  \s-2TEXT\s+2
\(bu  \s-2TEXT 3\s+2
\(bu  \s-2ANNOTATION TEXT RELATIVE\s+2
\(bu  \s-2ANNOTATION TEXT RELATIVE 3\s+2
.RE
.fi
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2,
a \s-2SET TEXT INDEX\s+2 element is inserted into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer. If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2,
the new \s-2SET TEXT INDEX\s+2 element
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer.
In either case, the element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIindex\fP
A \fItext index\fP for a text representation on the workstation.
.SS Execution
When the \s-2SET TEXT INDEX\s+2 element is traversed,
the `current text index' value is set to the \fItext index\fP,
which specifies an entry from the workstation's text bundle table.
The default \fItext index\fP is 1, and
if the \fItext index\fP specified is not available on the workstation,
1 will be used.
.LP
A text representation contains values for the following attributes:
.sp .2
.nf
.RS
\(bu  text font
\(bu  text precision
\(bu  character expansion factor
\(bu  character spacing
\(bu  text colour index
.fi
.RE
Text output primitives which follow in the structure network
will be drawn using the values from the specified representation
for those attributes whose Aspect Source Flag (ASF) is set to
\s-2BUNDLED\s+2.
When the \s-1ASF\s0s are \s-2INDIVIDUAL\s0,
the attributes come from the appropriate
.SM SET
.I attribute
elements.
.LP
Text representations are defined with
\s-2SET TEXT REPRESENTATION\s+2.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, STOP, *\s+2)
.IP 100
Ignoring function, the bundle index value is less than one
