.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET CHARACTER EXPANSION FACTOR\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the current character
expansion attribute, which changes the characters' width-to-height
ratio from the ratio with which the font was designed.
.LP
When the character expansion factor Aspect Source Flag (\s-2ASF\s+2)
is set to \s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2,
this attribute applies to the following output primitives:

.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIexp_factor\fP
A real value specifying the character expansion factor.
.SS Execution
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, a \s-2SET CHARACTER EXPANSION
FACTOR\s+2 element is inserted into the currently open structure after the
element pointed to by the current element pointer.  If the edit mode is
\s-2REPLACE\s+2, the new \s-2SET CHARACTER EXPANSION FACTOR\s+2 element
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer. In either case,
the element pointer is updated to point to the new element.  
When the \s-2SET CHARACTER EXPANSION FACTOR\s+2 element is traversed,
the current character expansion factor
entry in the traversal state list is set to exp_factor.  
.LP
When the current character expansion factor \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2, characters in text output primitives that follow in
the structure network are modified by the absolute value of
the expansion factor specified.  
.LP
The default character expansion factor is 1.0, 
which results in no change in the width-to-height ratio of characters
from their definition by the font designer.  
A character expansion factor
of less than 1.0 produces narrower characters,
and a character expansion factor
greater than 1.0 produces wider characters.  
.LP
When the character expansion factor \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to \s-2BUNDLED\s+2, the
character expansion factor is taken from the
workstation's representation indicated by the current text index.  
In this case, the expansion factor set with \s-2SET
CHARACTER EXPANSION FACTOR\s+2 has no effect.
