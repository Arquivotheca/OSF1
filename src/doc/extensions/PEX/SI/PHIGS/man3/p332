.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET INTERIOR SHADING METHOD\s+2
places a structure element with the value shading
method into the open structure. When the current interior shading
method Aspect Source Flag (\s-2ASF\s+2) is set to
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2, the current value of
this attribute applies to the following output primitives:

.SS Execution
Depending on the edit mode, a
\s-2SET INTERIOR SHADING METHOD\s+2
element is inserted into the open structure after the element pointer, or 
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer. In either case,
the element pointer is updated to point to the newly created
\s-2SET INTERIOR SHADING METHOD\s+2
element.
.LP
When the structure is traversed, the current interior
shading method entry in the traversal state list is set to the
specified value. This value is used with subsequent 
filled area output primitives
when the current interior shading method \s-2ASF\s+2 entry
in the traversal state list is \s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2.
During traversal, if the specified shading method is not available
on a workstation, method one (\fINone\fP) will be used on that workstation.
.LP
When the current interior shading method \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to \s-2BUNDLED\s+2,
the interior shading method is taken from the
workstation extended representation indicated by the current interior index.
In this case, the interior shading method
set with \s-2SET INTERIOR SHADING METHOD\s+2 has no effect.
.LP
The interior shading methods supported by a workstation type can be determined
with the function \s-2INQUIRE INTERIOR FACILITIES PLUS\s+2.
.LP
When the shading method is \s-2NONE\s+2, each fill area or fill area set will
be rendered in a single colour (this is sometimes called flat shading).
If the shading method is \s-2NONE\s+2 and the primitive data implies different
colours for each vertex of the primitive, such as when vertex colour is
specified or when lighting is active, the colour of the first vertex
will be used for all the vertices of the primitive.
.LP
When the shading method is \s-2COLOUR\s+2 and the workstation is in index colour
mode, then the colours will be interpolated as colour indices instead
of direct colours.
