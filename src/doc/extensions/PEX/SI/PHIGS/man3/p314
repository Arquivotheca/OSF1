.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
The \s-2SET EDIT MODE\s+2 subroutine sets the edit mode controlling how \s-2PHIGS\s+2 subroutines that create new structure elements will add the new element to the open structure.
The mode may be Insert or Replace.
.LP
Insert is the default.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fImode\fP
An enumerated variable specifying the edit mode to be used to add new elements to the open structure.
Valid values (defined in phigs.h) are:
.sp
.ta .3i
.nf
	PEDIT_INSERT
	PEDIT_REPLACE
.fi
.SS Execution
The \s-2SET EDIT MODE\s+2 subroutine sets the edit mode in the 
traversal state list to Insert or Replace. The value in this entry 
controls how \s-2PHIGS\s+2 subroutines that create new structure elements 
add the new element to the currently open structure.
.LP
While the edit mode is Insert, new structure elements are inserted into the open structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer.
.LP
While the edit mode is Replace, new structure elements replace the element in the open structure pointed to by the current element pointer.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (PHOP, *, *, *)
