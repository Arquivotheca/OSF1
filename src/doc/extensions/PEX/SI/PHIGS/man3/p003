.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS  Purpose
The 
\s-2ANNOTATION TEXT RELATIVE 3\s+2
subroutine puts a structure element 
containing the full specification of a three-dimensional
\s-2ANNOTATION TEXT RELATIVE 3\s+2
primitive into the currently open structure.
.LP
The
\s-2ANNOTATION TEXT RELATIVE 3\s+2
primitive is a character
string.  The location of the string in the display is controlled by the
\fIreference point\fP and \fIannotation offset\fP subroutine
parameters.  
\s-2ANNOTATION TEXT RELATIVE 3\s+2
primitives differ from
\s-2TEXT 3\s+2
primitives in that the reference point is
specified in Modelling Coordinates (\s-2MC\s+2), and the plane upon which the
characters are generated will always be parallel to the display surface
and in the Normalized Projection Coordinate (\s-2NPC\s+2) Space.  
Aspects of the text display,
such as the font, colour, spacing, height, and alignment, are controlled
by the current values of the primitive attributes listed below.
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, the structure element
created by the 
\s-2ANNOTATION TEXT RELATIVE 3\s+2
subroutine is inserted into the open structure after the element pointed to 
by the current \fIelement pointer\fP. If the current edit mode is 
\s-2REPLACE\s+2, the new 
\s-2ANNOTATION TEXT RELATIVE 3\s+2
element replaces the element in the structure pointed to by the 
element pointer.
In either case, the element pointer
is updated to point to the new
\s-2ANNOTATION TEXT RELATIVE 3\s+2
element.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIref_pt\fP
A pointer to a Ppoint3 structure containing the \fIx\fP, \fIy\fP, and \fIz\fP 
\s-2MC\s+2 that locate the annotation text.
The Ppoint3 structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pfloat     'u +\w'x;  'u
.nf
typedef struct  {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	x;      /* x coordinate */
	Pfloat	y;      /* y coordinate */
	Pfloat	z;      /* z coordinate */
.sp .2
} Ppoint3;
.sp
.fi
.IP \fIanno_offset\fP
A pointer to a Pvec3 structure containing the \fIx\fP, \fIy\fP,  
and \fIz\fP coordinates of the offset of the text string from the transformed
reference point.  The annotation offset specifies an offset in 
\s-2NPC\s+2.
The Pvec3 structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pfloat     'u +\w'delta_x;  'u
.nf
typedef struct  {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	delta_x;      /* x magnitude */
	Pfloat	delta_y;      /* y magnitude */
	Pfloat	delta_z;      /* z magnitude */
.sp .2
} Pvec3;
.sp
.fi
.IP \fItext\fP
A pointer to the character string to be written into the display.
.SS Execution
When the structure is traversed, the 
\s-2ANNOTATION TEXT RELATIVE 3\s+2
element draws the
specified character string on the plane in the \s-2NPC\s+2
System defined by reference point and the annotation offset.
These parameters define a Text Local Coordinate (\s-2TLC\s+2) System in
the \s-2NPC\s+2 System. 
The annotation offset added to the transformed reference point
defines the origin of this \s-2TLC\s+2 System. 
The \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP axes of the \s-2TLC\s+2 System are 
parallel to and have the same direction as the \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP 
axes of the \s-2NPC\s+2 System.
.LP
The precise position of the text is defined in relation to this plane by
the current values of the text primitive attributes
\s-2ANNOTATION TEXT CHARACTER UP VECTOR\s+2, \s-2ANNOTATION TEXT CHARACTER\s+2,
\s-2BASE VECTOR\s+2, \s-2ANNOTATION TEXT PATH\s+2, and \s-2ANNOTATION TEXT ALIGNMENT\s+2. 
The reference point is subject to the current transformations in the 
transformation pipeline from the \s-2MC\s+2 System to the workstation display.
The text itself is only subject to the transformations in the transformation
pipeline from the \s-2NPC\s+2 System to the workstation display.
.LP
Other aspects of the appearance of the text are controlled by the
attributes \s-2TEXT FONT\s+2, \s-2TEXT PRECISION\s+2, \s-2ANNOTATION STYLE\s+2,
\s-2ANNOTATION TEXT CHARACTER HEIGHT\s+2, \s-2ANNOTATION TEXT CHARACTER WIDTH\s+2,
\s-2CHARACTER EXPANSION FACTOR\s+2, \s-2CHARACTER SPACING\s+2, and
\s-2TEXT COLOUR INDEX\s+2.
.LP 
\s-2ANNOTATION TEXT CHARACTER WIDTH\s+2 and \s-2ANNOTATION TEXT BASE VECTOR\s+2
are implicit attributes derived from \s-2ANNOTATION TEXT CHARACTER HEIGHT\s+2
and \s-2ANNOTATION TEXT UP VECTOR\s+2, respectively.
.SS Attributes Applied
The attributes listed below are used to display the
\s-2ANNOTATION TEXT RELATIVE 3\s+2 primitive when the structure is traversed.
The Aspect Source 
Flags (\s-2ASF\s+2s) tell where to access the output display attributes. 
These attributes can come directly from the traversal state list,
or they can be accessed indirectly, using the appropriate index 
in the traversal state list and the corresponding bundled 
representation in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 workstation state list.
