.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\*f initializes \s-2PHIGS\s+2 and enables access to the \s-2PHIGS\s+2
functions.
\s-2OPEN PHIGS\s+2 
must be called prior to calling any other \s-2PHIGS\s+2 functions.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIerror_file\fP
A pointer to the \fIerror file\fP to log \s-2PHIGS\s+2 error messages to.
The \fIerror file\fP can be either a pointer to a
valid UNIX file name or a null pointer, for example (char*)0.
A null pointer implies that standard error is to be used as the error file.
If a file name is specified, \s-2PHIGS\s+2 will attempt to access the file
for writing.  If this attempt fails, \*f will fail and the appropriate
error will be reported to standard error.
.IP
The error file argument passed to \*f will be passed to \*h.
\*h will also pass this argument to \*l.
If for some reason \*l cannot access the specified error file,
the error message will be written to standard error.
\*l appends messages to the error file; it does not truncate the file when
\*f is called.  If the specified file does not exist, it will only be
created if \*l is called.
.IP 
\*l writes the abstract \s-2PHIGS\s+2 function name, the
error number, and an error description to the error file.
If for some reason the text for the function name
and/or error description can't be determined, \*l
will just write the function number and the error number.
.IP \fImemory\fP
This parameter is not used by the \s-2PEX-SI API\s+2.
.SS Execution
\s-2OPEN PHIGS\s+2:
.sp .4
.in .7i
.ta .5i
.ti -.2i
\(bu    Connects to a default or specified server. The default server is the one returned
by XDisplayName (\s-2NULL\s+2).
(\s-2OPEN XPHIGS\s+2 must be used to specify a server.)
.sp .2
.ti -.2i
\(bu    Sets the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 system state variable to \s-2`PHOP'\s+2.
.sp .2
.ti -.2i
\(bu    Initializes the default workstation description tables and makes them
available for use by the other \s-2PHIGS\s+2 functions.
These tables reflect the capabilities of the default or specified server.
.sp .2
.ti -.2i
\(bu    Creates the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 state list and initializes it with default values
taken from the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 description table.
.sp .2
.ti -.2i
\(bu    Stores \fIerror file\fP in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 error state list.
.DT
.sp
.LP
The default values for the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 state list,
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 description table, and workstation description tables
are in the Appendix.
.LP
When an error in \s-2PHIGS\s+2 is detected, \*h is called and passes three
items of informations: the \fIerror file\fP, the function number of the
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 function that detected the error, and the error number.
\*h calls \*l, which writes an error message to the error file.
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 users can replace \*h with a function of their own.
This function may in turn call \*l.
See \*h and \*l for more information.
.LP
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 only writes to the error file if \*l is called, either by
\*h or the application.  If the \fIerror file\fP does not exist when
\*f is called, it will only be created if and when \*l is called.
.LP
.SH ERRORS
.IP 001
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHCL, WSCL, STCL, ARCL\s+2)
.IP 450
Ignoring function, the specified error file is invalid
