.IX "Structures" "EMPTY STRUCTURE"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS C Syntax
.ft B

pempty_struct ( struct_id )
Pint	struct_id;	\fIstructure id\fP
.fi
.ft R
.SS Required PHIGS Operating States

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2EMPTY STRUCTURE\s+2 to remove all the structure elements from a specified structure. The structure continues to exist as an empty structure even if there are no references to it in other structures. Any references that do exist are not changed by the \s-2EMPTY STRUCTURE\s+2 subroutine.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIstruct_id \fP
Specifies the structure from which all structure elements should be removed.
.SS Execution
The \s-2EMPTY STRUCTURE\s+2 subroutine removes all the structure elements from structure identifier.  The structure specified may be the open structure, another existing structure, or a non-existent structure.
.sp
If structure identifier is the currently open structure or an existing structure, \s-2EMPTY STRUCTURE\s+2 removes all elements from the structure and sets the element pointer to 0. Any references to this structure in other structures are not changed.
.sp
If the structure specified by structure identifier does not exist, \s-2EMPTY STRUCTURE\s+2 creates a new empty structure.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
