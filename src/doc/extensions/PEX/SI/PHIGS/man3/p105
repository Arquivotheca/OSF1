.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2INQUIRE CURVE AND SURFACE FACILITIES\s+2
returns the available curve and
surface facilities associated with the specified workstation type.
.SS C Input Parameters
All of the following data types are predefined in phigs.h.
.IP \fItype\fP
The workstation type in question.
.IP \fIcat_len\fP
The number of entries to return from the list of
curve approximation types.
.IP \fIcat_st\fP
The starting position of the portion of the list to return.
.IP \fIsat_len\fP
The number of entries to return from the list of
surface approximation types.
.IP \fIsat_st\fP
The starting position of the portion of the list to return.
.IP \fItcat_len\fP
The number of entries to return from the list of
trimming curve approximation types.
.IP \fItcat_st\fP
The starting position of the portion of the list to return.
.IP \fIpsc_len\fP
The number of entries to return from the list of
parametric surface characteristics.
.IP \fIpsc_st\fP
The starting position of the portion of the list to return.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error detected
by this function.
.IP \fIfacil\fP
A pointer to a Pcurvsurf_facs structure which returns the
requested information.  Pcurvsurf_facs is defined as:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint_list     'u +\w'max_bsp_order;     'u
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	max_bsp_order;	/* maximum B-spline order */
	Pint	max_pp_order;	/* maximum parametric polynomial order */
	Pint	max_tc_order;	/* maximum trim curve order */
	Pint_list	ppc_types;	/* list of parametric polynomial curve types */
	Pint_list	pps_types;	/* list of parametric polynomial surface types*/
	Pint_list	cat_types;	/* list of curve approximation types */
	Pint_list	sat_types;	/* list of surface approximation types */
	Pint_list	tcat_types;	/* list of trim curve approximation types */
	Pint_list	psc_types;	/* list of parametric surface characteristics types */
	Pint	num_pred_inds;	/* number of predefined bundles */
.sp .2
} Pcurvsurf_facs;
.fi
.IP
Pint_list is defined as:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'integers;     'u
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of integers */
.sp .2

.IP
Prior to calling this function, the integers field of the Pint_list
structures must contain a pointer to an array of integers.  This array
must be at least as large as the corresponding \fIlen\fP parameter.
.IP \fItot_cat_len\fP
A pointer to an integer which returns the total length of the
curve approximation type
list as stored in the workstation description table.
.IP \fItot_sat_len\fP
A pointer to an integer which returns the total length of the
surface approximation type
list as stored in the workstation description table.
.IP \fItot_tcat_len\fP
A pointer to an integer which returns the total length of the
trimming curve approximation type
list as stored in the workstation description table.
.IP \fItot_psc_len\fP
A pointer to an integer which returns the total length of the
parametric surface characteristics.
list as stored in the workstation description table.
.SS Execution
If the inquired information is available, the error indicator is returned
as zero and values are returned in the output parameters.
.LP
If the inquired information is not available, the values returned in the
output parameters are undefined and the error indicator is set 
to one of the error numbers listed below to indicate the reason for 
non-availability.
.LP
Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not invoked
when an error is detected by this function.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 051
.\"Ignoring function, this information is unavailable for this workstation type
Ignoring function, this information is
not yet available for this generic
workstation type; open a workstation of
this type and use the specific workstation type
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 059
