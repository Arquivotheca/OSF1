.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET CHARACTER SPACING\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the current character spacing attribute, 
which controls how much space is inserted between characters in a
text string.  
.LP
When the character spacing Aspect Source Flag (\s-2ASF\s+2)
is set to \s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2,
this attribute applies to the following output primitives:

.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIspacing\fP
The character spacing, specified as a real
fraction of the font's nominal character height.
.SS Execution
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, then 
a \s-2SET CHARACTER SPACING\s+2 element is inserted in the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer.  If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, then the new \s-2SET CHARACTER SPACING\s+2
element
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer.  In either case, the
element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.LP
When the \s-2SET CHARACTER SPACING\s+2 element is traversed, the current
character spacing entry in the traversal state list is set to
character spacing.  
When the current character spacing \s-2ASF\s+2 
is set to \s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2, the character spacing 
is applied to text strings in 
output primitives that follow in the structure network.
.LP
The character spacing attribute specifies the amount of space to be
inserted between the character bodies in the text primitives.  
A positive value inserts additional space between 
characters, and a negative value causes the character bodies to
overlap.  The default value is 0.0:  the character bodies
are placed adjacent to one another, with no additional space
beyond that in the font design.  
(A character's body is the rectangle that encloses the
limits of the character.)  
.LP
When the character spacing \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to \s-2BUNDLED\s+2, 
the character spacing will be taken from the
workstation's representation indicated by the current text index.  
In this case, the spacing set with \s-2SET
CHARACTER SPACING\s+2 has no effect.
