.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\*f synchronizes with a workstation.  This function calls XSync() on all
connections \s-2PHIGS\s+2 is using to communicate with the server associated with
the specified workstation.  This has the effect of flushing X connections
and waiting for requests sent to the workstation to be processed.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIfunc_id\fP
The function identifier for this escape is \s-2PUESC_WS_SYNCH\s+2,
which is defined in phigs.h to be -7.
.IP \fIin\fP
A pointer to a Pescape_in_data union, which contains the escape_in_u7 member
used by this escape function.
This member is defined in phigs.h as:
.nf
.ta .5i +.75i +1i
.sp .4
struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	ws_id;		/* workstation id */
.sp .2
} escape_in_u7;	/* workstation synch */
.fi
.RS
.IP \fIws_id\fP
Indicates the workstation to synchronize with.
.RE
.IP \fIstore\fP
This parameter is not used in this escape function.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIout\fP
This parameter is not used by this escape.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state (PHOP, WSOP, *, *)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
