.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2INQUIRE ANNOTATION FACILITIES\s+2 obtains a list of the 
annotation text facilities available on the specified workstation type.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fItype\fP
Workstation type.
.IP \fIlength\fP
The number of \fIints\fR items in the \fIstyles\fP output parameter for
which the application has allocated memory.
The \fIlength\fP is the number of list elements (annotation styles)
that the system can return in the list of integers in the Pint_list structure
under \fIstyles\fP.
If a value of zero is used here, no data will be returned in this
list, but the
total number of annotation styles available on the specified workstation type
will be returned in \fItotal_length\fP.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position in the workstation type list of available annotation styles
at which the inquiry is to begin.
The elements of the list of annotation styles, beginning
with the item number specified by \fIstart\fP, are copied sequentially
into the list of integers until it
is full or all the annotation styles have been copied.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error detected
by this function.
.IP \fIstyles\fP
A pointer to a Pint_list structure in which the system returns 
the list of annotation styles available on the specified type of workstation.
Pint_list is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'*num_ints;     'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of integers */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
.sp
The \fInum_ints\fP component specifies the number of annotation styles
in the list. The \fIints\fP component is a pointer to a list,
\fInum_ints\fP long, of the annotation styles.
.sp
The application must allocate memory for \fIlength\fP elements in
the list of \fIints\fP.
.bp
.IP
The defined values for the annotation styles are:
.nf
.ta .5i +.25i
	1	PANNO_STYLE_UNCONNECTED
	2	PANNO_STYLE_LEAD_LINE
.fi
.IP \fItotal_length\fP
A pointer to an integer in which the total number of
elements in the specified workstation type list of annotation styles
is returned.
This is the value required for
\fIlength\fP if all annotation styles are to be returned.
.IP \fInum_char_hts\fR
A pointer to an integer in which the number of character heights is returned.
.IP \fImin_char_ht\fR
A pointer to an integer in which the minimum character height is returned.
.IP \fImax_char_ht\fR
A pointer to an integer in which the maximum character height is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, *\s+2)
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 051
Ignoring function, this information is not yet available
for this workstation type; open a workstation of this type
and use the specific workstation type
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have
output capability (i.e., the workstation category is neither 
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 062
Ignoring function, this information is not available for this
\s-2MO\s+2 workstation type
