.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2INQUIRE GENERALIZED DRAWING PRIMITIVE\s+2 determines the
sets of attributes used by the specified generalized drawing primitive.
The representation of the generalized drawing primitive at a given
workstation will be controlled by zero or more sets of polyline, polymarker,
text, interior, and edge attributes, as indicated by this inquiry function.
Whether bundle indices or the corresponding individual attributes are
used will depend on the values of the appropriate aspect source flags
at traversal time.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws_type\fP
Type of workstation for which to inquire the generalized drawing primitive
attributes.
.IP \fIgdp\fP
The identifier of the generalized drawing primitive for which to
inquire attributes.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fInum_attrs\fR
A pointer to an integer that indicates how many attributes are listed in
\fIattrs\fR.
.IP \fIattrs\fP
A Pattrs structure indicating which set of attributes are used by the specified
generalized drawing primitive on workstations of type \fItype\fP.
Pattrs is an enumerated type defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +1.5i
.nf
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PATTR_LINE,	/* polyline attributes */
	PATTR_MARKER,	/* marker attributes */
	PATTR_TEXT,	/* text attributes */
	PATTR_INT,	/* interior attributes */
	PATTR_EDGE	/* edge attributes */
.sp .2
} Pattrs;
.sp .4
.fi
.SS Execution
.LP
If the inquired information is available, the error indicator is returned
as zero and values are returned in the output parameters.
.LP
If the inquired information is not available, the values returned in the
output parameters are undefined and the error indicator is
set to one of the below error numbers to indicate the reason for
nonavailability.
.LP
Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not invoked
when an error is detected by this function.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP\s+2, *, *, *)
.IP 051
Ignoring function, this information is
not yet available for this generic
workstation type; open a workstation of
this type and use the specific
workstation type
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified
workstation does not have output capability (that is, the workstation category
is neither \s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 062
Ignoring function, this information is not available for this
\s-2MO\s+2 workstation type
.IP 064
Ignoring function, the specified workstation type is not able to generate
the specified generalized drawing primitive
