.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET COLOUR MAPPING INDEX\s+2
creates an element in the currently open structure containing a
colour mapping index. The index number corresponds to an entry
in the table of defined colour mapping representations in the
workstation state list.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIindex\fR
This is an index to the workstation colour mapping bundle table.
.SS Execution
Depending on the edit mode, a \s-2SET COLOUR MAPPING INDEX\s+2
element with a value colour mapping index is inserted into the open
structure after the element pointer or replaces the element pointed
to by the element pointer. The element pointer is then updated to point
to this \s-2SET COLOUR MAPPING INDEX\s+2 element.
.LP
When a \s-2SET COLOUR MAPPING INDEX\s+2 structure element is traversed, 
the current colour mapping index value 
in the \s-2PHIGS\s0 Extension traversal state list is set to 
index. This value indexes a colour mapping representation in the 
table of defined colour mapping operations stored in the workstation state list.
If the entry corresponding to the specified index
is not defined, then an entry of zero is substituted in the index.
.LP
The current colour mapping index determines the colour mapping operation that
will be applied to all primitives subsequently displayed.
.sp .2
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP,*,STOP,*\s+2)
.IP 121
Ignoring function, the colour mapping index is less than 0.
