.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET DEPTH CUE INDEX\s+2
creates an element in the currently open structure containing a
depth cue index number. The index number corresponds to an entry
in the table of defined depth cue operations in the workstation state list.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIindex\fR
This is an index to the workstation depth cue bundle table.
.IP
The index number corresponds to an entry in the table of defined
depth cue operations in the workstation state list. Up to 20
depth cue table entries may be defined. Entry zero is predefined 
to a depth cue mode of 
\s-2SUPPRESSED\s+2 and cannot be changed. Entries other than 
zero can be 
changed with the \s-2SET DEPTH CUE REPRESENTATION\s+2 subroutine.
.SS Execution
Depending on the edit mode, a \s-2SET DEPTH CUE INDEX\s+2
element with a value depth cue index is inserted into the open
structure after the element pointer or replaces the element pointed
to by the element pointer. The element pointer is then updated to point
to this \s-2SET DEPTH CUE INDEX\s+2 element.
.LP
When a \s-2SET DEPTH CUE INDEX\s+2 structure element is traversed, 
the current depth cue index value 
in the \s-2PHIGS\s0 Extension traversal state list is set to 
index. This value indexes a depth cue representation in the 
table of defined depth cue operations stored in the workstation state list.
If the entry corresponding to the specified index
is not defined, then an entry of zero is substituted in the index.
.LP
The current depth cue index determines the depth cue operation that
will be applied to all primitives in the display. Each entry in the 
workstation table of defined depth cue operations contains the
following information:
.RS
\(bu  depth cue index number
.sp .2
\(bu  depth cue mode (\s-2SUPPRESSED\s+2 
or
\s-2ALLOWED\s+2)
.sp .2
\(bu  depth cue reference planes
.sp .2
\(bu  depth cue scale factors
.sp .2
\(bu  depth cue color
.RE
.sp .4
.\".LP
If the depth cue mode is \s-2SUPPRESSED\s+2, depth cueing is not applied
to subsequent primitives in the display. 
If the depth cue mode is \s-2ALLOWED\s+2,
depth cueing is applied to all subsequent primitives using the 
operation defined by the reference planes, scale factors, and 
depth cue color.
.LP
When a workstation is opened, entries zero and one are initialized 
with the following representation:
.sp .5
.nf
.ta .5i +.5i +.5i +1i +1.5i
				\fIEntry 0		Entry 1\fP
.sp .2
	depth cue mode		SUPPRESSED	ALLOWED
	depth cue reference planes	0.0, 1.0	0.0, 1.0
	depth cue scaling		1.0, 1.0	0.0, 1.0
	depth cue colour		(INDIRECT, 0)	(INDIRECT, 0)
.fi
.sp .5
.LP
For depth cue reference planes and depth cue scaling, the first
value is the back reference plane and scaling.
.sp .2
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP,*,STOP,*\s+2)
.IP 063
Ignoring function, the depth cue index value is less than zero
