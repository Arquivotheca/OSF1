.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
The \s-2SET CONFLICT RESOLUTION\s+2 subroutine sets the conflict resolution
flags controlling how structure archival and retrieval conflicts are resolved.  
The flag value can be \s-2MAINTAIN\s+2, \s-2ABANDON\s+2, or \s-2UPDATE\s+2.  
.LP
The default value of the archival conflict resolution flag is \s-2UPDATE\s+2.  
The default value of the retrieval conflict resolution flag is \s-2ABANDON\s+2.  
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIarchival_resolution\fP
An enumerated variable specifying the value of the archival 
conflict resolution flag.
.IP \fIretrieval_resolution\fP
An enumerated variable specifying the value of the retrieval 
conflict resolution flag.
.LP
Valid values (defined in phigs.h) for these two flags are:
.sp .2
.ta .3i
.nf
	PRES_MAINTAIN
	PRES_ABANDON
	PRES_UPD
.fi
.SS Execution
The \s-2SET CONFLICT RESOLUTION\s+2 subroutine sets the conflict resolution
flags in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 workstation state list.  
The archival conflict resolution flag controls what happens when an attempt
is made to archive structures whose identifiers already exist in the archive
file.  
The retrieval conflict resolution flag controls what happens when an attempt
is made to retrieve structures whose identifiers already exist in the Central
Structure Store.  
.LP
The flag values can be \s-2MAINTAIN\s+2, \s-2ABANDON\s+2, or \s-2UPDATE\s+2.  
A value of \s-2MAINTAIN\s+2 prevents conflicting structures from being
overwritten;  a value of \s-2UPDATE\s+2 allows conflicting structures to be
overwritten;  and a value of \s-2ABANDON\s+2 indicates that the entire
archival or retrieval operation should be abandoned, with no changes made
to the archive or the Central Structure Store if there are any conflicts.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
