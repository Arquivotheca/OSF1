.SH NAME
REDRAW ALL STRUCTURES \- redisplay all structures posted to a workstation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS C Syntax
.ft B
.ta 1.25i 3i
.nf

Pint	ws;	\fIworkstation identifier\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2REDRAW ALL STRUCTURES\s+2 updates the specified
workstation's display by:
.RS
.ta 0.2i +0.2i +0.2i +0.2i +0.2i
.LP
\(bu
Completing any actions in progress
.LP
\(bu
Clearing the display surface if the surface is \s-2NOT EMPTY\s+2,
or if the \fIcontrol flag\fP is \s-2ALWAYS\s+2
.LP
\(bu
Updating any pending viewing transformation and pending \s-2HLHSR\s+2 mode
.LP
\(bu
Redisplaying all structures posted to the workstation
.LP
\(bu
Setting the workstation's \fIstate of visual representation\fP
to \s-2CORRECT\s+2
.ta
.RE
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The identifier of the workstation whose structures are to be redrawn.
.IP \fIcontrol_flag\fP
Controls whether the display surface is
automatically cleared.
Pctrl_flag is defined in phigs.h.
Valid values are:
.sp .4
.ta .5i
.nf
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PFLAG_COND,
	PFLAG_ALWAYS
.sp .2
}Pctrl_flag;
.fi
.IP
\s-2PFLAG_COND\s+2 clears the display surface before redrawing only if
the surface is not empty.
.IP
\s-2PFLAG_ALWAYS\s+2
automatically clears the surface before redrawing.
.SS Execution
\s-2REDRAW ALL STRUCTURES\s+2 performs the following actions in
sequence:
.sp .5v
.in +0.5i
.ta +0.2i
.ti -0.2i
1.	Any buffered communications for the specified workstation
are completed without first clearing the display surface.
.\"
.\" I'm think \s-2PEX-SI\s0 never has any data that hasn't been flushed. -wds
.\"
.\"		Actions below must match those for UPDATE WORKSTATION!
.\"
.sp .5v
.ti -0.2i
2.	If the \fIcontrol flag\fP is set to \s-2CONDITIONALLY\s+2, then the
workstation's display surface is only cleared if
it is \s-2NOT EMPTY\s+2. If the control
flag is set to \s-2ALWAYS\s+2, the display surface is cleared regardless
of whether the display is \s-2EMPTY\s+2. In any case,
the entry is then set to \s-2EMPTY\s+2.
.IP
\fBNote:\fP
Using a control flag of \s-2CONDITIONALLY\s+2
avoids unnecessarily clearing an empty display surface.
A value of \s-2ALWAYS\s+2 is useful when generating 
multiple copies of the current image on hardcopy devices.
However, for \s-2PEX-SI\s+2 where an output device is always
a \s-2CRT\s+2, the value \s-2ALWAYS\s+2 is not meaningful.
.sp .5v
.ti -0.2i
3.	For every view representation in the workstation's state list,
if the \fIview transformation update state\fP is \s-2PENDING\s+2,
the current view representation is loaded from the \fIrequested\fP view
representation,
and the update state is set to \s-2NOTPENDING\s+2.
.sp .5v
.ti -0.2i
4.	If the workstation transformation update state is \s-2PENDING\s+2,
the \fIcurrent workstation window\fP and \fIcurrent workstation viewport\fP
are loaded with the \fIrequested\fP values for each,
and the update state is set to \s-2NOTPENDING\s+2.
.sp .5v
.ti -0.2i
5.	If the workstation's \fI\s-2HLHSR\s+2 update state\fP
is \s-2PENDING\s+2, the \fIcurrent \s-2HLHSR\s+2 mode\fP is updated
to the value of the \fIrequested \s-2HLHSR\s+2 mode\fP, and
the update state is set to \s-2NOTPENDING\s+2.
.sp .5v
.ti -0.2i
6.	All structure networks posted for this workstation are redisplayed
in the order of their priority.
.sp .5v
.ti -0.2i
7.	The workstation's \fIstate of visual representation\fP is set
to \s-2CORRECT\s+2.
.LP
The workstation's state of visual representation indicates
if the display is \s-2CORRECT\s+2, \s-2SIMULATED\s+2, or \s-2DEFERRED\s+2.
\s-2INQUIRE DISPLAY UPDATE STATE\s+2 returns the
workstation's \fIdisplay surface empty\fP and state of visual representation
state list entries.
Normally, the traversal in Step 6 causes
the display surface empty workstation state to become \s-2NOTEMPTY\s+2.
(If all the posted structures are empty, or if they contain elements but no
output primitive elements, the display surface empty may be
\s-2EMPTY\s+2 or \s-2NOTEMPTY\s+2.)
.DT
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2WSOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(i.e., the workstation category is neither \s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
