.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
The \s-2TEXT 3\s+2 subroutine puts a structure element
containing the full specification of a three-dimensional
\s-2TEXT 3\s+2 primitive into the currently open structure.
.LP
The \s-2TEXT 3\s+2 primitive is a character string. The location and
orientation of the string in the display is controlled by the
\fItext point\fP and \fIdirection vectors\fP subroutine parameters,
specified in Modelling Coordinates (\s-2MC\s+2).
Other aspects of the text display, such as the font, colour, spacing,
height, and alignment, are controlled by the current values of the
primitive attributes listed below.
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, the structure element created
by the \s-2TEXT 3\s+2 subroutine is inserted into the open structure after
the element pointed to by the current element pointer. If the current
edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the \s-2TEXT 3\s+2 element replaces the
element in the structure pointed to by the element pointer.  In either
case, the element pointer is updated to point to the new \s-2TEXT 3\s+2
element.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fItext_pt\fP
A pointer to a Ppoint3 structure that specifies the \fIx, y\fP, and \fIz\fP
coordinates that locate the text string.
The Ppoint3 structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pfloat     'u +\w'x;     'u
.nf
typedef struct  {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	x;	/* x coordinate */
	Pfloat	y;	/* y coordinate */
	Pfloat	z;	/* z coordinate */
.sp .2
} Ppoint3;
.fi
.IP \fIdir\fP
An array of two Pvec3 structures containing direction vectors.
The Pvec3 structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pfloat	'u +\w'delta_x;		'u
.nf
typedef struct  {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	delta_x;	/* x magnitude */
	Pfloat	delta_y;	/* y magnitude */
	Pfloat	delta_z;	/* z magnitude */
.sp .2
} Pvec3;
.fi
.IP \fItext\fP
A pointer to the character string to be written into the display.
.SS Execution
When the structure is traversed, the \s-2TEXT 3\s+2 element draws the
specified character string on the plane in the \s-2MC\s+2
system defined by \fItext point\fP and the two \fIdirection vectors\fP.
These parameters define a Text Local Coordinate (\s-2TLC\s+2)
system in the \s-2MC\s+2 system. The \fItext point\fP parameter
defines the origin of this
\s-2TLC\s+2 system, the first direction vector defines the
positive \fIx\fP axis, and the second direction vector
defines the positive
\fIy\fP axis.
Only the directions, not the lengths, of these vectors are relevant.
.LP
The precise position of the text is defined in relation to this plane by
the current values of the text primitive attributes \s-2CHARACTER UP
VECTOR, TEXT PATH,\s+2 and \s-2TEXT ALIGNMENT\s+2. The text
primitive is subject to the current transformations in
the transformation pipeline from
the \s-2MC\s+2 system to the workstation display.
.LP
Other aspects of the appearance of the text are controlled by the
attributes \s-2TEXT FONT, TEXT PRECISION, CHARACTER HEIGHT, CHARACTER
WIDTH, CHARACTER EXPANSION FACTOR, CHARACTER SPACING,\s+2 and
\s-2TEXT COLOUR INDEX\s+2.
.SS Attributes Applied
The attributes listed below are used to display the
\s-2TEXT 3\s+2 primitive when the structure is traversed. The Aspect Source 
Flags (\s-2ASF\s+2s) tell where to access the output display attributes. 
These attributes can come directly from the traversal state list,
or they can be accessed indirectly, using the appropriate index 
in the traversal state list and the corresponding bundled 
representation in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 workstation state list.
