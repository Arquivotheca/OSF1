.SH NAME
INQUIRE SYSTEM STATE VALUE \- inquire state value of PHIGS
.IX "Operating States" "INQUIRE SYSTEM STATE VALUE"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS C Syntax

pinq_sys_st ( sys_state )
Psys_st	*sys_state;	\fIOUT the system state\fP

.SS Required PHIGS Operating States
(*, *, *, *)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE SYSTEM STATE VALUE\s+2 to determine the current state of
the PHIGS system. The state value may be either \fI\s-2PHIGS\s+2 open\fP (\s-2PHOP\s+2)
or \fI\s-2PHIGS\s+2 closed\fP (\s-2PHCL\s+2).
.LP
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 must be opened with the \s-2OPEN PHIGS\s+2 subroutine before any operations can be performed with the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 subroutines.
This function may be used to verify that \s-2OPEN PHIGS\s+2 was
successful before performing additional \s-2PHIGS\s+2 operations.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIsys_state \fP
A pointer to a Psys_st enumerated variable in which the current state
of the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 system is returned.
Values for Psys_st are defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +1.25i
.sp .4
typdef enum {
.sp .2
	PSYS_ST_PHCL,	/* \s-2PHIGS\s+2 closed */
	PSYS_ST_PHOP	/* \s-2PHIGS\s+2 open */
.sp .2
} Psys_st;
