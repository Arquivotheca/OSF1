.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET COLOUR MODEL\s+2 selects the colour model used to represent colours
in the workstation's table of defined colour representations, which is 
used to specify a primitive's colour attribute.
.LP
.\"PHIGS+:	when the appropriate CSF (\s-2POLYLINE, POLYMARKER, TEXT,
.\"PHIGS+:	NTERIOR,\s+2 or \s-2EDGE\s+2) is set to \s-2INDEXED\s+2.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
Set the colour model for the workstation with identifier \fIws\fP.
.IP \fImodel\fP
Use this colour model to interpret the colour values
in the workstation colour table.  Values defined in phigs.h are:

	4	PMODEL_HLS	\fIHue, lightness, saturation\fP
.fi
.SS Execution
When \s-2SET COLOUR MODEL\s+2 is called, the current colour model entry
in the workstation state list is set to colour model,
which selects a method of interpreting the colour bundles in the
workstation table of defined colour representations.  
Each entry on the colour table contains three colour values.
When the current colour model is set to \fIRed, Green, Blue\fP,
these values are interpreted as the red, green and
blue components, respectively, of the colour in \s-2RGB\s+2 colour space.  
.\"PHIGS+   .LP
.\"PHIGS+   When the Colour Source Flag (CSF) for \s-2POLYLINE, POLYMARKER,
.\"PHIGS+  TEXT, INTERIOR,\s+2or \s-2EDGE\s+2 is set to \s-2INDEXED\s+2, the
.\"PHIGS+  colour for the corresponding primitive is specified as an index
.\"PHIGS+  into this colour table.  When the primitive's CSF \(eq
.\"PHIGS+  \s-2INDEXED\s+2, the primitive's colour Aspect Source Flag (ASF)
.\"PHIGS+  determines whether the current colour index value is taken from
.\"PHIGS+  the current defined representation for that primitive (ASF \(eq
.\"PHIGS+  \s-2BUNDLED\s+2), or from the current individual colour setting
.\"PHIGS+  for the primitive (ASF \(eq \s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2).

.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2WSOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(in other words, the workstation category is neither \s-2OUTPUT\s+2,
\s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2) 
.IP 110
Ignoring function, the specified colour model is not available
on the workstation.
