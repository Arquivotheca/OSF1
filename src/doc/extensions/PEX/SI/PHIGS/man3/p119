.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2INQUIRE DEPTH CUE FACILITIES\s+2
returns the number of predefined depth cure indices
associated with the specified workstation type.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fItype\fP
The workstation type.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any
error detected by this function.
.IP \fIfacilities\fP
A pointer to the location to store the number of predefined indices.
.SS Execution
If the inquired information is available, the error indicator is returned
as zero and values are returned in the output parameters.
.LP
If the inquired information is not available, the values returned in the
output parameters are undefined and the error indicator
is set to one of the following error numbers to indicate the reason
for nonavailability.
.LP
Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not
invoked when an error is detected by this function.
