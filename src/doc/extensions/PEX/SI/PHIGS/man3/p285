.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET ANNOTATION TEXT PATH\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the text path attribute that controls the 
direction in which the string is written 
relative to the character up and base vectors.  
This attribute applies to the following output primitives:
.RS
.LP
\(bu
.SM "ANNOTATION TEXT RELATIVE"
.LP
\(bu
.SM "ANNOTATION TEXT RELATIVE 3"
.RE
.LP
.fi
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, then 
a \s-2SET ANNOTATION TEXT PATH\s+2 element is inserted into the 
currently open structure after the element pointed to by the 
current element pointer.  
If the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, then 
the new \s-2SET ANNOTATION TEXT PATH\s+2 
element replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer.  
In either case, the element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIpath\fP
The annotation text path is one of the following 
enumerated values:
.sp .2
.ta .5i +\w'PPATH_DOWN 'u
.nf
	PPATH_RIGHT	    \fIRight\fP
	PPATH_LEFT	    \fILeft\fP
	PPATH_UP	    \fIUP\fP
	PPATH_DOWN	    \fIDown\fP
.sp .2
.fi
.SS Execution
When the \s-2SET ANNOTATION TEXT PATH\s+2 element is traversed, 
the current annotation text path
entry in the traversal state list is set to annotation text path.  
The annotation text path determines the direction of displacement between
one character and the next in a string, defined in relation to the
annotation text character base and up vectors.  
.LP
If annotation text path is set to Right, then the text string is written
along a base line in the direction of the \s-2ANNOTATION TEXT CHARACTER 
BASE VECTOR\s+2.  
If it is set to Left, then the text string is written
along a base line in the direction opposite to the \s-2ANNOTATION TEXT 
CHARACTER BASE VECTOR\s+2.  
If it is set to Up, then the text string is written in
the direction of the \s-2ANNOTATION TEXT CHARACTER UP VECTOR\s+2.  
If it is set to Down, then the text string is written in
the direction opposite to the \s-2ANNOTATION TEXT CHARACTER UP VECTOR\s+2.  
.LP
The \s-2ANNOTATION TEXT CHARACTER BASE VECTOR\s+2 attribute is an implicit
attribute derived from the \s-2ANNOTATION TEXT CHARACTER UP VECTOR\s+2.  
.LP
\fBNote:\fP Annotation text path controls only the direction in 
which the string is written.     
The position of the string in relation to the text position
point is controlled by the \fIannotation text alignment\fP.
.SH ERRORS
