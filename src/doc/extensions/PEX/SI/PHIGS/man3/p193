.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE PREDEFINED INTERIOR REPRESENTATION\s+2 to determine
the predefined interior representation for a specified workstation type
at a given interior index.
.LP
.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fItype \fP
Type of workstation.
.IP \fIindex \fP
Entry to be returned from the workstation table of predefined interior
representations.
.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIbundle\fP
A pointer to a Pint_bundle structure in which the system returns the interior representation at \fIindex\fP in the workstation table of predefined interior representations.  Pint_bundle is defined in phigs.h as:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint_style     'u +\w'style_ind;     'u
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint_style	style;	/* interior style */
	Pint	style_ind;	/* interior style index */
	Pint	colr_ind;	/* interior colour index */
.sp .2
} Pint_bundle; 
.fi
.sp .2
Pint_style is defined in phigs.h as:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pint_style     'u +\w'colour;     'u
.nf
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PSTYLE_HOLLOW,
	PSTYLE_SOLID,
	PSTYLE_PAT,
	PSTYLE_HATCH,
	PSTYLE_EMPTY
.sp .2
} Pint_style;
.fi
.IP
See \s-2SET INTERIOR STYLE\s+2 for a description of each style.
.SS Execution
.LP
If the inquired information is available, the error indicator is returned
as zero and values are returned in the output parameters.
.LP
If the inquired information is not available, the values returned in the
output parameters are undefined and the error indicator is
set to one of the below error numbers to indicate the reason for
nonavailability.
.LP
Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not invoked
when an error is detected by this function.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 051
Ignoring function, this information is not yet available
for this workstation type; open a workstation of this type
and use the specific workstation type
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have
output capability (in other words, the workstation category is neither 
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 062
Ignoring function, this information is not available for this
\s-2MO\s+2 workstation type
.IP 100
Ignoring function, the bundle index value is less than one
.IP 102
Ignoring function, the specified representation has not been predefined
on this workstation
