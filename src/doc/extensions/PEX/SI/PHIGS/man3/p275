.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2SAMPLE STRING\s+2 to sample the current measure of the specified
string device without waiting for input from the operator. The device
must be in \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 mode.
See \s-2SET STRING MODE\s+2 and \s-2INITIALIZE STRING\s+2 for more information.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
Workstation identifier. An integer specifying the workstation with which
the specified string device is associated.
.IP \fIdev\fP
The device number of the string device to be sampled.
See the \fIAvailable Devices\fP section of \s-2INITIALIZE STRING\s+2
for a description of the available devices.
.SS C Output Parameter
.IP \fIstring\fP
A pointer to a character array in which to store the \s-2STRING\s+2 measure.
The string is null terminated.
The array should be at least as large as the buffer of the
\s-2STRING\s+2 device.
This buffer size is set when the device is initialized.
.SS Execution
\s-2SAMPLE STRING\s+2 samples the specified string device.  The
device must be in \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 mode.
See \s-2SET STRING MODE\s+2 and \s-2INITIALIZE STRING\s+2 for more
information.
.LP
When a device is set to \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 mode, a measure process is created
for the device and the device is activated.  When \s-2SAMPLE STRING\s+2 is
called, the current value of the measure process for the specified device
is retrieved without waiting for further input from the operator.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2WSOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 061
Ignoring function, specified workstation is neither of category \s-2INPUT\s+2
nor of category \s-2OUTIN\s+2
.IP 250
Ignoring function, the specified device is not available
on the specified workstation
.IP 252
Ignoring function, the function requires the input
device to be in \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 mode
