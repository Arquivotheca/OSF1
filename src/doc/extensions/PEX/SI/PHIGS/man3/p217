.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE TEXT FACILITIES\s+2 to obtain a list of the text facilities available on the specified workstation type.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fItype\fP
Workstation type.
.IP \fIlength\fP
The \fIlength\fP is
the number 
of text font and precision (fps) pairs which the \fIfacilities\fP output
parameter can return in 
the allocated memory space.  A length of zero may be specified 
in order to have \fItotal_length\fP 
return the total number of elements in the workstation list of available 
font and precision pairs.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position in the list of font and precision pairs in the 
workstation description table at which to begin the inquiry.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIfacilities\fP
A pointer to a Ptext_facs data structure in which the system returns a listing of 
the text facilities available on this type of workstation. Ptext_facs is defined 
in phigs.h as:
.nf
.ta .5i +1.0i +1.5i
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_font_precs;	/* number of fonts and precisions */
	Ptext_font_prec	*font_precs;	/* list of fonts and precisions */
	Pint	num_char_hts;	/* number of character heights */
	Pfloat	min_char_ht;	/* minimum height */
	Pfloat	max_char_ht;	/* maximum height */
	Pint	num_char_expans;	/* number of character expansion factors */
	Pfloat	min_char_expan;	/* minimum expansion factor */
	Pfloat	max_char_expan; 	/* maximum expansion factor */
	Pint	num_pred_inds;	/* number of predefined bundles */ 
.sp .2
} Ptext_facs;
.fi
.sp .4
Ptext_font_prec is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +1.0i +1.5i
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	font;	/* text font */
	Ptext_prec	prec;	/* text precision */
.sp .2
} Ptext_font_prec;
.sp .4
.fi
Ptext_prec is an enumerated type with the following values:
.nf
.ta .5i
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PPREC_STRING,
	PPREC_CHAR,
	PPREC_STROKE
.sp .2
} Ptext_prec;
.fi
.IP \fItotal_length\fP
An integer pointer in which the system returns the total number of items in 
the list of available font and precision pairs on the workstation description
table. This is the value required for \fIlength\fP if all the items in the 
workstation list are to be returned.
.IP
The application must allocate memory for the text facilities list of
fonts and precisions.
.SS Execution
.LP
If the inquired information is available, the error indicator is returned
as zero and values are returned in the output parameters.
.LP
If the inquired information is not available, the values returned in the
output parameters are undefined and the error indicator is
set to one of the below error numbers to indicate the reason for
nonavailability.
.LP
Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not invoked
when an error is detected by this function.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, *\s+2)
.IP 051
Ignoring function, this information is not yet available
for this workstation type; open a workstation of this type
and use the specific workstation type
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have
output capability (that is, the workstation category is neither 
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 062
Ignoring function, this information is not available for this
\s-2MO\s+2 workstation type
