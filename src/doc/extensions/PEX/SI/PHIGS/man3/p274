.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2SAMPLE PICK\s+2 to sample the current measure of the specified
pick device without waiting for input from the operator. The device
must be in \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 mode.
See \s-2SET PICK MODE\s+2 and \s-2INITIALIZE PICK\s+2 for more information.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
Workstation identifier. An integer specifying the workstation with which
the specified pick device is associated.
.IP \fIdev\fP
The device number of the pick device to be sampled.
See the \fIAvailable Devices\fP section of \s-2INITIALIZE PICK\s+2
for a description of the available devices.
.IP \fIdepth\fP
The maximum number of path elements to return.
.SS C Output Parameter
.IP \fIpick_in_status\fP
Pin_status is defined in phigs.h as:
.sp .4
.nf
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PIN_STATUS_NONE,
	PIN_STATUS_OK,
	PIN_STATUS_NO_IN
.sp .2
} Pin_status;
.fi
.IP \fIrpick\fP
Ppick_path is defined in phigs.h as:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Ppick_path_elem     'u +\w'*path_list;     'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	depth;	/* pick path depth */
	Ppick_path_elem	*path_list;	/* pick path list */
.sp .2
} Ppick_path;
.fi
.IP
\fIdepth\fP indicates the number of elements in the measure's path.  
This is the depth value contained in the device's current measure.  
It is not affected by the \fImaximum depth to return\fP parameter.  
Thus the number of elements returned in \fIpath_list\fP may be less than
\fIdepth\fP.  
.IP
\fIpath_list\fP is the array of path elements defining the location of the
picked primitive in the Central Structure Store (\s-2CSS\s+2).
\fBThis array must be allocated by the calling program
and the array pointer assigned to this field before calling this
function.\fP
The array must be at least of length \fImaximum depth to return\fP.
Ppick_path_elem is defined in phigs.h as:
.bp
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'struct_id;     'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	struct_id;	/* structure identifier */
	Pint	pick_id;	/* pick identifier */
	Pint	elem_pos;	/* element number */
.sp .2
} Ppick_path_elem;
.fi
.IP
\fIstruct_id\fP, \fIpick_id\fP, and \fIelem_pos\fP are the 
structure identifier, pick identifier, and element number, 
respectively, of each element in the path.
.SS Execution
\s-2SAMPLE PICK\s+2 samples the specified pick device. The
device must be in \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 mode.
See \s-2SET PICK MODE\s+2 and \s-2INITIALIZE PICK\s+2 for more
information.
.LP
When a device is set to \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 mode, a measure process is created
for the device and the device is activated. When \s-2SAMPLE PICK\s+2 is
called, the current value of the measure process for the specified device
is retrieved without waiting for further input from the operator.
.LP
A \s-2PICK\s+2 device measure consists of a \fIstatus\fP and a
\fIpick path\fP.
The \fIstatus\fP indicates whether or not a pick by the operator was successfully
resolved.
The \fIpath\fP describes the location of the picked primitive, if any,
in the \fICentral Structure Store\fP (\s-2CSS\s+2).
The \fIpick filter\fP of a \s-2PICK\s+2 device controls which output
primitives on the device's workstation are pickable.
By default, no output primitives are pickable.
See \s-2SET PICK FILTER\s+2 for more information on the \fIpick filter\fP.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state (PHOP, WSOP, *, *)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 060
Ignoring function, specified workstation is not of category \s-2OUTIN\s+2
.IP 250
Ignoring function, the specified device is not available
on the specified workstation
.IP 252

device to be in \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 mode
