.SS Execution
.LP
\s-2INITIALIZE STROKE\s+2 sets the initialization parameters of a
\s-2STROKE\s+2 device.
This function stores these parameters in the workstation state list
of the workstation associated with the specified device.
The specified device must be in \s-2REQUEST\s+2 mode when this
function is called.
.LP
The parameters that are initialized by this function are 
\fIinitial stroke\fP,
\fIprompt/echo type\fP,
\fIecho volume\fP,
and
\fIinput data record\fP.
.LP
The \fIinitial stroke\fP is the logical input value the device will be
set to whenever it is enabled.
The device's measure will retain this value until operator input changes it.
A device is enabled when the appropriate \s-2REQUEST\s+2 function is called,
or when its input mode is set to \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 or \s-2EVENT\s+2.
.LP
A \s-2STROKE\s+2 device measure consists of \fIpoints\fP and a
\fIview index\fP.
The \fIpoints\fP are World Coordinate (\s-2WC\s+2) points corresponding to the
positions on the workstation selected by the operator.
The \fIview index\fP is the index of the view representation used to
transform the stroke positions from Normalized Projection
Coordinates (\s-2NPC\s+2) to \s-2WC\s+2.
This view representation is determined by selecting the highest priority
representation that contains all the stroke positions within its \s-2NPC\s+2 limits.
See \s-2SET VIEW TRANSFORMATION INPUT PRIORITY\s+2 for more information.
The workstation transform is used to transform the operator-selected
positions from Device Coordinates (\s-2DC\s+2) to \s-2NPC\s+2.
.LP
The initial stroke points are transformed to \s-2DC\s+2 by
applying the view orientation and view mapping transforms of the specified
view representation, and then applying the workstation transformation.
If the view index is invalid, an error is generated.
.LP
The \fIprompt/echo type\fP determines how the device will be presented
to the operator and respond to his actions.
Each device supports one or more prompt/echo types.
Those supported by each device are listed in the device's
description in the \fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section below.
All devices support prompt/echo type 1.
Positive prompt/echo types are defined by the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 standard.
Negative types are implementation-dependent.
.LP
The \fIecho volume\fP defines the region of the display surface in which to
echo the device.
It is specified in \s-2DC\s+2.
Devices that use the echo volume may restrict their display to this region.  
Some of these devices may still recognize operator input
outside the region even though they do not display there.  
This function specifies only the \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP components of the
echo volume.  
The existing \fIz\fP component in the workstation state list is left unchanged. 
.LP
The \fIinput data record\fP contains the prompt/echo type specific
information that controls the device's appearance and characteristics.
Not all of the data record contents are used by some devices.
The device descriptions in the \fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section below
list the data record contents that each device recognizes.
.LP
Stroke devices contain a buffer in which to store the points selected
by the operator.  Points are added to the buffer starting at the edit
position.  Both the buffer size and the edit position are specified in the
input data record.
.LP
All the initialization parameters must be specified properly, or this function
will generate an error.
The \s-2\fIERRORS\fP\s+2 section below lists the possible error conditions.
.LP
The default initialization parameters and the list of prompt/echo types
supported by a \s-2STROKE\s+2 input device can be inquired with the function
\s-2INQUIRE DEFAULT STROKE DEVICE DATA\s+2.
The current state of the device can be inquired with the function
\s-2INQUIRE STROKE DEVICE STATE\s+2.
.SH AVAILABLE DEVICES
.SS Device 1 - "Pointer device"
.LP
This device is associated with the X pointer device.
The stroke points in the \s-2STROKE\s+2 device's measure are the 
\s-2WC\s+2 points corresponding to the positions specified in an
operator-generated series of X pointer events.
The operator adds points to the buffer by
positioning the cursor to the desired location and depressing the
left pointer button.  Once all the desired points are selected, 
the operator presses both the shift key and the left mouse
button at the same time.  This triggers the stroke.
Points can be removed from the buffer by pressing the \s-2CONTROL\s+2 key
and pointer button simultaneously.  Only points after the \fIedit position\fP
can be removed in this way.
.LP
\fBPrompt/echo types supported\fP: 1
.IP "PET 1" .8i
Display the stroke points by drawing a marker at each stroke position.
The marker used is of marker type 3 (asterisk), size 1.0, and uses colour
index 1.
.LP
This device uses the \fIbuffer_size\fP and \fIinit_pos\fP fields of the
stroke data record, Pstroke_data.
