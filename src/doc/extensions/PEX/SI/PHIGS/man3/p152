.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE LIST OF AVAILABLE GENERALIZED DRAWING PRIMITIVES 3\s+2 
to obtain a list of the identifiers of the \s-2\&3D\s+2
generalized drawing primitives
(\s-2GDP\s+2)s available on the specified workstation type.
.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fItype\fP
Workstation type.
.IP \fIlength\fP
The number of \fIints\fP items in the \fIgdps\fP output parameter for
which the application has allocated memory.
The \fIlength\fP is the number of list elements (\s-2GDP 3\s+2 identifiers)
that the system can return in the list of integers.
If a value of zero is used here, no data will be returned in the
list of integers, but the
total number of \s-2GDP 3\s+2s available on the specified workstation type
will be returned in \fItotal_length\fP.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position in the workstation type list of \s-2\&3D\s+2 generalized
drawing primitive ids at which the inquiry is to begin.
The elements of the list of \s-2GDP 3\s+2 identifiers, beginning
with the item number specified by \fIstart\fP, are copied sequentially
into the list of integers until it
is full or all the \s-2GDP 3\s+2 identifiers have been copied.
.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error detected
by this function.
.IP \fIgdps\fP
A pointer to a Pint_list structure in which the system returns 
the list of identifiers of the \s-2GDP 3\s+2s
available on the specified type of workstation.
Pint_list is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'num_ints;     'u
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of integers */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
.sp
The \fInum_ints\fP component specifies the number of \s-2GDP 3\s+2 identifiers
in the list. The \fIints\fP component is a pointer to a list,
\fInum_ints\fP long, of the \s-2GDP 3\s+2 identifiers.
.sp
The application must allocate memory for \fIlength\fP elements in
the list of integers.
.IP \fItotal_length\fP
A pointer to an integer in which the total number of
elements in the specified workstation type list of available \s-2GDP 3\s+2s
is returned.
This is the value required for
\fIlength\fP if all \s-2GDP 3\s+2 identifiers are to be returned.
.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, *\s+2)
.IP 051
Ignoring function, this information is not yet available
for this workstation type; open a workstation of this type
and use the specific workstation type
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have
output capability (that is, the workstation category is neither
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2 \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 062
Ignoring function, this information is not available for this
\s-2MO\s+2 workstation type
