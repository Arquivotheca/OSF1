.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET LOCATOR MODE\s+2 sets the operating mode and echo switch for a
specified locator device on a specified workstation.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The workstation identifier of the workstation associated with the device.
.IP \fIdev\fP
The device number of the locator device to be set.  
See the \fIAvailable Devices\fP section in \s-2INITIALIZE LOCATOR 3\s+2
for a description of the available devices.
.IP \fImode\fP
Specifies the operating mode for the specified locator device.
Pop_mode is an enumeration defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.sp .4
.ta .5i
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	POP_REQ,
	POP_SAMPLE,
	POP_EVENT
.sp .2
} Pop_mode;
.fi
.IP \fIecho\fP
The echo switch value for the specified locator device.
Pecho_switch is an enumeration defined in phigs.h as follows:  
.nf
.sp .4
.ta .5i
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PSWITCH_NO_ECHO,
	PSWITCH_ECHO
.sp .2
} Pecho_switch;
.fi
.SS Execution
.LP
\s-2SET LOCATOR MODE\s+2 sets the operating mode and echo flag of the specified
device.
The default operating mode is \s-2POP_REQ\s+2.
The default echo switch is \s-2PSWITCH_ECHO\s+2.
.LP
The operating mode controls how the input from the device is obtained:
.sp .5v
.in +0.5i
.ta +0.2i
.ti -0.2i
\(bu	If the operating mode is \s-2REQUEST\s+2,
\s-2REQUEST LOCATOR {3}\s+2 may be used to prompt for and receive input from
a locator input device.
\s-2REQUEST LOCATOR {3}\s+2 will not return until the operator enters input to
the device.
.sp .5v
.ti -0.2i
\(bu	If the operating mode is \s-2SAMPLE\s+2,
\s-2SAMPLE LOCATOR {3}\s+2 may be used to 
return the current input value of the device without waiting for operator
input.
.sp .5v
.ti -0.2i
\(bu	If the operating mode is \s-2EVENT\s+2,
the input values generated by the operator are added to the \s-2PHIGS\s+2
input event queue.
The functions \s-2AWAIT EVENT\s+2 and \s-2GET LOCATOR {3}\s+2 may then be used
to retrieve these events from the input queue.
.DT
.sp
.LP
The echo switch may be used by some devices to control whether or not values
selected by the operator are echoed to the device.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003

Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 061
Ignoring function, specified workstation is neither of category \s-2INPUT\s+2
nor of category \s-2OUTIN\s+2
.IP 250
Ignoring function, the specified device is not available
on the specified workstation
