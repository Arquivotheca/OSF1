.SH NAME
RETRIEVE STRUCTURES \- retrieve specified structures from an archive file
.IX "Archive Files" "RETRIEVE STRUCTURES"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS C Syntax
.ft B
.ta 1.25i 3i

Pint	archive_id;	\fIarchive identifier\fP
Pint_list	*struct_ids;	\fIlist of structure identifiers\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2RETRIEVE STRUCTURES\s+2 to retrieve a list of structures
from the specified open archive file into the \s-2CSS\s+2.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIarchive_id\fP
The archive identifier specifying the open archive file to read from.
.IP \fIstruct_ids\fP
A pointer to a Pint_list structure containing the list of structure
identifiers to be retrieved.
The Pint_list structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'num_ints;     'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of integers */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
.IP
The \fInum_ints\fP component specifies the number of structure identifiers
in the list.
.IP
The \fIints\fP component is a pointer to a list,
\fInum_ints\fP long, of the structure identifiers.
.SS Execution
The specified structures are copied from the indicated open archive file
into the Central Structure Store (\s-2CSS\s+2).
If any of the structures to be retrieved currently
exist in the \s-2CSS\s+2, the conflict is resolved as follows:
.sp .5v
.in +0.5i
.ta +0.2i
.ti -0.2i
\(bu	If the retrieval conflict resolution flag is \s-2MAINTAIN\s+2,
then the conflicting structure will not be copied
into the \s-2CSS\s+2
(its contents are maintained).
.sp .5v
.ti -0.2i
\(bu	If the retrieval conflict resolution flag is \s-2UPDATE\s+2,
then the conflicting structure in the \s-2CSS\s+2 will be overwritten
(its contents are updated).
.sp .5v
.ti -0.2i
\(bu	If the retrieval conflict resolution flag is \s-2ABANDON\s+2,
then no structures will be copied to the \s-2CSS\s+2.
.LP
The retrieval conflict resolution flag is set by the 
\s-2SET CONFLICT RESOLUTION\s+2 subroutine.
.LP
If the currently open structure must be overwritten because
of a conflict while
the retrieval conflict resolution flag is \s-2UPDATE\s+2, then
it is closed, its contents are
overwritten, and it is re-opened. The element pointer will be set to point
to the last element.
.LP
If any of the structures to be retrieved do not exist in the
archive file, then an empty structure is created in the
\s-2CSS\s+2, a warning is generated, and the retrieval operation
continues for the remaining structures.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 007
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, AROP\s+2)
.IP 404
Ignoring function, the specified archive file is not open
.IP 405
Ignoring function, name conflict occurred while conflict resolution flag
has value \s-2ABANDON\s+2
.IP 408
Warning, some of the specified structures do not exist on the archive file.
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 will create empty structures in their places
