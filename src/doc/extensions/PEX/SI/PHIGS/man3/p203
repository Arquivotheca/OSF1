.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2INQUIRE PREDEFINED TEXT REPRESENTATION PLUS\s+2 
returns the attribute values of a specified predefined entry in the
extended text bundle table of a workstation type's workstation description
table.  See \s-2SET TEXT REPRESENTATION PLUS\s+2 for a full description of the
contents of the bundle table entry and a description of the extended text bundle
table.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fItype\fP
The workstation type.
.IP \fIindex\fP
Index of the predefined entry to be returned.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number
of any error detected by this function.
.IP \fIbundle\fP
A pointer to a Ptext_bundle_plus structure that returns the
specified extended text representation.
Ptext_bundle_plus is defined as:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Ptext_prec     'u +\w'char_expan;     'u
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	font;	/* text font */
	Ptext_prec	prec;	/* text precision */
	Pfloat	char_expan;	/* character expansion factor */
	Pfloat	char_space;	/* character spacing */
	Pgcolr	colr;	/* text colour */
.sp .2
} Ptext_bundle_plus;
.fi
.IP
See \s-2SET TEXT REPRESENTATION PLUS\s+2 for a full description
of the contents of this structure.
.SS Execution
.LP
If the inquired information is available, the error indicator is returned
as zero and values are returned in the output parameters.
.LP
If the inquired information is not available, the values returned in the
output parameters are undefined and the error indicator is
set to one of the following error numbers to indicate the reason for
nonavailability.
.LP
Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not invoked
when an error is detected by this function.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, *\s+2)
.IP 051
Ignoring function, this information unavailable for this workstation type
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 059 
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(i.e., the workstation category is neither \s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 062
Ignoring function, this information is not available for this
\s-2MO\s+2 workstation type
.IP 100
Ignoring function, the bundle index value is less than one
.IP 102
Ignoring function, the specified representation has not been predefined
on this workstation
