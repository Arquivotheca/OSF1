.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE COLOUR MAPPING METHOD FACILITIES\s+2 to obtain the
available colour mapping facilities specific to a specified colour mapping
method.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fItype\fP
The workstation type for which to get the colour mapping method facilities.
.IP \fImap_method\fR
The colour mapping method of interest.
The colour mapping methods defined in phigs.h are as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +.5i
	1	PCOLR_MAP_TRUE
	2	PCOLR_MAP_PSUEDO
	3	PCOLR_MAP_PSEUDO_N
.fi
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fImap_st\fP
A pointer to a Pcolr_map_st structure
in which to store the information.
Pcolr_map_st is defined in phigs.h as:
.ta .5i +1i +1i
.nf
.sp .2
typedef union {
.sp .2
	Pint	int_data;	\fIfor map_method 1 and 2\fR
.sp .2
} Pcolr_map_st;
.sp .2
.fi
.IP
For colour mapping method \s-2PCOLR_MAP_TRUE\s+2, \fIint_data\fP will contain the
number of available true colours.
For colour mapping method \s-2PCOLR_MAP_PSEUDO\s+2, \fIint_data\fP will contain the
maximum number of available pseudo colour entries.
There is no information returned for colour mapping method \s-2PCOLR_MAP_PSEUDO_N\s+2.
.SS Execution
If the inquired information is available, the error indicator is
returned as zero and the requested information is returned.
.LP
If the inquired information is not available, the values returned
in the output parameters are undefined and the error
indicator is set to one of the following error numbers to indicate
the reason for nonavailability.
.LP
Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not 
invoked when an error is detected by this function.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, *\s+2)
.IP 051
Ignoring function, this information is not yet available
for this workstation type; open a workstation of this type
and use the specific workstation type
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have
output capability (that is, the workstation category is neither 
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2 nor \s-2OUTIN\s+2)
.IP 062
Ignoring function, this information is not available for this
\s-2MO\s+2 workstation type
.IP 126
Ignoring function, the specified colour mapping method is not
available on the specified workstation.
