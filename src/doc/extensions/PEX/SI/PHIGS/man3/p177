.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE PHIGS FACILITIES\s+2 to obtain a list of the available
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 facilities from the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 description table.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIlength\fP
The number of list elements for which the application has allocated memory
in the output parameter \fIchar_sets\fR\(->\fIints\fP.
0 may be specified, in order to have \fIlength_list\fP
return the total number of elements in the list of character sets.
.IP \fIstart\fP
The starting position in the list at which the inquiry is to begin.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIopen_ws\fP
A pointer to an integer that returns the
\fImaximum number of simultaneously open workstations\fP supported.
.IP \fIopen_ar\fP
A pointer to an integer that returns the
\fImaximum number of simultaneously open archive files\fP supported.
.IP \fInum_names\fP
A pointer to an integer that returns the number of available names for name sets.
.IP \fIchar_sets\fP
A pointer to a data structure that returns a portion
of the list of available character sets, starting with
the \fIstart\fP number item.
Pint_list is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint	'u +\w'num_ints;		'u
.sp .3
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	 num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of integers */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
.IP
Prior to calling this function, the \fIints\fR field of the Pint_list
structure must contain a pointer to an application supplied buffer.
This buffer must be at least as large as the \fIlength\fR parameter.
.IP \fIlength_list\fP
A pointer to an integer that returns the length of the list in \s-2PHIGS\s+2.
.IP \fInorm_filt\fP
A pointer to an integer that returns the
maximum length of the norm filter list for Incremental Spatial Search.
.IP \fIinv_filt\fP
A pointer to an integer that returns the
maximum length of the inverted filter list for Incremental Spatial Search.
.SH ERRORS
