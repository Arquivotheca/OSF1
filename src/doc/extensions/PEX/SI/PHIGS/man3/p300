.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET COLOUR REPRESENTATION\s+2
defines an entry in the workstation's colour table.  
Each entry in this table contains three component values,
defining a colour in the current colour model.  
.\"TRUE: \fBNote:\fP Only the RGB colour model is supported in this release.
.\"PHIGS+:	The table of defined colours is used to specify colour
.\"PHIGS+:	attributes when the appropriate CSF (\s-2POLYLINE,
.\"PHIGS+:	POLYMARKER, TEXT, INTERIOR,\s+2 or \s-2EDGE\s+2) is set to
.\"PHIGS+:	\s-2INDEXED\s+2.
The colour representations apply to all primitives.  
.LP
\fBNote:\fP \s-2PEX-SI\s+2 presently supports only the \s-2RGB\s+2 colour model.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The identifier of the workstation for which the colour
representation is being defined.  
.IP \fIindex\fP
The \fIcolour index\fP of the entry being defined.  
.IP \fIrep\fP
A pointer to a union containing the 
three \fIcolour components\fP defining the colour representation.

.SS Execution
When \s-2SET COLOUR REPRESENTATION\s+2 is called,
the colour index entry in
the table of defined colour representations on the workstation is set to
the three colour components specified.  
.LP
For the \s-2RGB\s+2 colour model, the only one implemented in this release,
the range for these colour components is 0 to 1:  
0 sets the colour component off;  
1 sets the colour component at full intensity.
.\"PHIGS+:	When the Colour Source Flag (CSF) for \s-2POLYLINE,
.\"PHIGS+:	POLYMARKER, TEXT, INTERIOR,\s+2or \s-2EDGE\s+2 is set to
.\"PHIGS+:	\s-2INDEXED\s+2, the colour for the corresponding
.\"PHIGS+:	primitive is specified as an index into this colour
.\"PHIGS+:	table.
.\"PHIGS+:	.LP
.\"PHIGS+:	When CSF \(eq \s-2INDEXED\s+2, the primitive's colour
.\"PHIGS+:	Aspect Source Flag (ASF) determines whether the current
.\"PHIGS+:	index value is taken from the currently selected defined
.\"PHIGS+:	representation for the primitive (ASF \(eq
.\"PHIGS+:	\s-2BUNDLED\s+2), or from the current colour index
.\"PHIGS+:	individually specified for the primitive (ASF \(eq
.\"PHIGS+:	\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2).
.LP
The colour table is numbered from 0, the background colour,
to a workstation-dependent maximum.  
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2WSOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(in other words, the workstation category is neither \s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2) 
.IP 113
Ignoring function, the colour index value is less than zero
.IP 103
Ignoring function, setting this bundle table entry would exceed
the maximum number of entries allowed in the workstation bundle table
.IP 118
Ignoring function, one of the components of the colour specification
is out of range.  
The valid range is dependent upon the current colour model
