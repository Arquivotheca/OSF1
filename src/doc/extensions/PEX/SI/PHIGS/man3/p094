.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2INQUIRE COLOUR MAPPING FACILITIES\s+2
returns the available colour mapping facilities for a specified
workstation type.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fItype\fP
The workstation type.
.IP \fIlength\fR
The number of Pint entries in the array the application has allocated and
assigned to \fIcolr_map_facs\fR\(->\fImethods.ints\fR.
If zero is specified then the list of available colour mapping methods will
not be returned, but the number of available colour mapping methods will be
returned in the \fItotal_length\fR argument.
.IP \fIstart\fR
Starting position of inquiry.  The elements in the list, beginning
with the item number specified by \fIstart\fR, are copied sequentially into 
\fIcolr_map_facs\(->methods.ints\fR until \fIcolr_maps_facs\(->methods.ints\fR is full
or all the elements have been copied.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any
error detected by this function.
.IP \fIcolr_map_facs\fP
A pointer to to the variable in which to store the colour mapping facilities.
Pcolr_map_facs is defined in phigs.h as:
.ta .5i +1i +1.25i
.nf
.sp .2
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint_list	meths;	/* available colour mapping methods */
	Pint	num_pred_inds;	/* number of predefined indices */
.sp .2
 } Pcolr_map_facs;
.sp .2
.fi
.IP
\fInum_pred_ind\fP returns the number of predfined colour mapping
representations.
.IP
\fImeths\fP returns the number and list of available colour mapping
methods for the specified workstation type.
Pint_list is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +1i +1.25i
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of integers        */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
fi
.IP
The \fInum_ints\fR component specifies the number of elements in the list.
The \fIints\fR component is a pointer to a list \fInum_ints\fR long.
.IP
The application must allocate memory for \fIlength\fR elements in the
list of \fIints\fR.
.IP
The pre-defined colour mapping methods in phigs.h are:
.nf
.ta .5i +.5i
	1	PCOLR_MAP_TRUE
	2	PCOLR_MAP_PSEUDO
	3	PCOLR_MAP_PSEUDO_N
.fi
.IP \fItotal_length\fR
A pointer to the integer in which to return the length of the list.
This is the value required for \fIlength\fR if all the items in the 
list are to be returned.
.SS Execution
If the inquired information is available, the error indicator is returned
as zero and values are returned in the output parameters.
.LP
If the inquired information is not available, the values returned in the
output parameters are undefined and the error indicator
is set to one of the following error numbers to indicate the reason
for nonavailability.
.LP
Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not
invoked when an error is detected by this function.
.SS Errors
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP,*,*,*\s+2)
.IP 051
Ignoring function, this information is not yet available for this generic
workstation type; open a workstation of this type and use the specific 
workstation type
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(i.e. the workstation category is neither \s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 062
Ignoring function, this information is not available for this
\s-2MO\s+2 workstation type
