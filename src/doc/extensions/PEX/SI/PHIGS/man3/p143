.SH NAME
INQUIRE INPUT QUEUE OVERFLOW \- inquire the \fIinput queue overflow\fP
state of the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 error state list

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE INPUT QUEUE OVERFLOW\s+2 to retrieve the
\fIinput queue overflow\fP information from the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 error state list.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error detected
by this function.
.IP \fIws\fP
A pointer to a Pint in which to store the workstation
identifier of the workstation associated with the input device that
caused the overflow.
.IP \fIclass\fP
A pointer to a Pin_class structure in which to store the class of the
input device that caused the overflow.
.IP
\fIPin_class\fP is an enumerated type that may assume the following values:
.ta .5i
.sp .2
.nf
	PIN_NONE
	PIN_LOC
	PIN_STROKE
	PIN_VAL
	PIN_CHOICE
	PIN_PICK
	PIN_STRING
.fi
.IP \fIdev\fP
A pointer to a Pint in which to store the number of the input device
that overflowed the input queue.
.SS Execution
When the input queue overflows, the identification of one of the logical
input devices that caused the overflow is placed in the error state list.
This information remains in the error state list until:
.sp .2
.ta .5i
.nf
	\(bu  The workstation associated with the input device is closed
	\(bu  \s-2PHIGS\s+2 is closed
	\(bu  This function is called
.fi
.sp .2
Calling this function clears the input queue overflow information in the
error state list.
If the input queue has not overflowed since this function or
\s-2OPEN PHIGS\s+2 was last called the appropriate error will be returned
in \fIerror indicator\fP.
.LP
When the input queue overflows, no more events can be added to it until
\s-2AWAIT EVENT\s+2 is called with the queue empty, i.e.,
all events must be removed from the queue,
and \s-2AWAIT EVENT\s+2 called \fBwhile the queue is empty\fP
before any new events can be added.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state \s-2(PHOP, WSOP, *, *)\s+2
.IP 257
Ignoring function, input queue has not overflowed
.IP 258
Warning, input queue has overflowed, but associated workstation has been closed
