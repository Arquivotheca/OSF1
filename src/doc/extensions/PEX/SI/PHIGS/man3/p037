.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2DELETE STRUCTURES FROM ARCHIVE\s+2 to delete a list of structures
from the specified open archive file.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIarchive_id\fP
The archive identifier specifying the open archive file to delete from.
.IP \fIstruct_ids\fP
A pointer to a Pint_list structure containing the list of structure
identifiers to be deleted.
The Pint_list structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'*num_ints;     'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of integers */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
.sp
The \fInum_ints\fP component specifies the number of structure identifiers
in the list. The \fIints\fP component is a pointer to a list,
\fInum_ints\fP long, of the structure identifiers.
.SS Execution
The specified structures are deleted from the archive file.
No attempt is made to ensure that the deleted structures are not referenced
from other structures in the archive file.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 007
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, AROP\s+2)
.IP 404
Ignoring function, the specified archive file is not open
.IP 407
Warning, some of the specified structures do not exist on the archive file
