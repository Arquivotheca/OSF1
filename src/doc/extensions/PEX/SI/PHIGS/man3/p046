.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\*f
disables or enables Device Coordinate \s-2(DC)\s+2 bounds checking by
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 functions with \s-2DC\s+2 input parameters (such as
\s-2SET WORKSTATION VIEWPORT\s+2 and the input device initialization
functions).
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIfunc_id\fP
The function identifier for this escape is \s-2PUESC_IGNORE_DC_ERRORS\s+2,
which is defined in phigs.h to be -3.
.IP \fIin\fP
A pointer to a Pescape_in_data union, which contains the escape_in_u3 member
used by this escape function.
This member is defined in phigs.h as:
.nf
.ta .5i +.5i +1.25i
.sp .4
struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	ignore_DC_errors;	/* ignore errors if non-zero */
.sp .2
} escape_in_u3;
.fi
.IP
\fIignore_DC_errors\fP
indicates if \s-2DC\s+2 bounds checking is enabled (0, the default) or
disabled (non-zero).
.IP \fIstore\fP
Not used.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIout\fP
There is no output data record for this escape.
.SS Execution
This escape disables or enables bounds checking of \s-2DC\s+2
parameters specifed to \s-2PHIGS\s+2 functions.
A number of \s-2PHIGS\s+2 workstation functions have \s-2DC\s+2 values as
parameters.
Normally these values are checked against the current \s-2DC\s+2 size of the
workstation when the function is called, and an error is reported if any
of the values lie outside the current limits.
The function then returns without performing the desired operation.
This escape is used to override that behavior by indicating that \s-2DC\s+2 values
outside the current workstation limits should be accepted.
This allows such \s-2DC\s+2 values to be entered into the workstation state list
and used in subsequent \s-2PHIGS\s+2 operations.
The use of these values in not defined by the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 standard, but
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 will use them as it would values that are within range.
This may produce results that do not conform to the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 standard.
It is the application's responsibility to ensure that the results of
\s-2PHIGS'\s+2 use of these out-of-range values is meaningful.
