.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
.IX "Element Pointer" "SET ELEMENT POINTER"
.IX "Current Element Pointer" "SET ELEMENT POINTER"
Use \s-2SET ELEMENT POINTER\s+2 to set the element pointer in the currently open structure to point to the element numbered \fIep_value\fP. Editing of the structure contents, such as adding or deleting elements, is done in relation to the current element pointer position.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIep_value \fP
Specifies the number of the structure element in the currently open structure 
to which the element pointer should be set.
.SS Execution
The \s-2SET ELEMENT POINTER\s+2 subroutine sets the current element
pointer to \fIep_value\fP. The element pointer value is the
number of the element in the currently open structure at which operations
on the structure contents begin. For example, subroutines that add new
structure elements put the new element into the currently open structure
in relation to the element pointer; the new element is inserted into the
structure after the element pointed to by the element pointer, or replaces
the element pointed to by the element pointer.
.LP
If the pointer value is specified as less than 0, the element pointer is
set to 0. If the pointer value is greater than the number of
elements in the open structure, the element pointer will be set to the
last element in the structure.
