.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\*f displays a message (character string) on the specified workstation.
See \fIExecution\fP below for a description of the placement of the
message on the workstation.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The workstation to send the message to.
.IP \fImsg\fP
The null terminated array of char (character string) to display on the
workstation.
.SS Execution
\*f displays the specified character string on the specified workstation.
The location of the message's display is dependent upon the workstation
type as follows:
.IP "\fIx_tool\fR and \fIx_drawable\fR workstation types"
If the workstation has a text subwindow associated with it, the message is
written to that window.  If a \s-2STRING\s+2 input device is also active
and using the text subwindow, the message will be interleaved (correctly)
with the operator input.
.IP
If the workstation does not have a text subwindow associated with it, the
message will be written to the lower left corner of the workstation's
graphics window and will be removed upon the next clearing of that window.
See \s-2UPDATE WORKSTATION\s+2 and \s-2SET DISPLAY UPDATE STATE\s+2 for a
description of when the window is cleared.  See \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE
SET\s+2 for a description of how to associate a text subwindow with a
workstation.
.LP
The \s-2MESSAGE\s+2 function only display a message when the \s-2PM\s+2 is running.
If the \s-2PM\s+2 is not running then the function is silently ignored.
.LP
When the \s-2PM\s+2 is running the message function causes a window to pop up
on the display.
The window contains the message and a button labelled ``Done''.
Selecting the Done button causes the window to disappear.
.LP
The message window is implemented with Athena widgets.
The resource database attributes recognized by the message window
and the default values are:
.nf
.ta .5i +2i
	*message.box.orientation	vertical,
	*message.box.allowResize	True,
	*message*label.resize	True,
	*message*button.label	Done
