.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE CONFLICTING STRUCTURES IN NETWORK\s+2 to obtain a list of the
identifiers of all structures in a specified network that exist in both
the Central Structure Store and the specified open archive file.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIar_id\fP
The archive identifier specifying the open archive file to use.
.IP \fIstruct_id\fP
The identifier of the root structure of the network.
.IP \fIsrc\fP
The structure network source, defined in phigs.h as:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'PNET_AR     'u
.sp
	PNET_CSS	\fICentral Structure Store\fP
	PNET_AR 	\fIArchive\fP
.fi
.sp
.IP \fIlength\fP
The number of \fIintegers\fP items in the \fIids\fP output parameter for
which the application has allocated memory.
\fIlength\fP is the number of list elements (structure identifiers)
that the system can return in \fIids\->integers\fP.
If a value of 0 is used here, no data will be returned in the
\fIids\->integers\fP list, but the
total number of conflicting structures will be returned in \fItotal_length\fP.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position in the list of identifiers of conflicting structures
at which to begin the inquiry.
The elements of the list of structure identifiers, beginning
with the item number specified by \fIstart\fP, are copied sequentially
into \fIids\->integers\fP until \fIids\->integers\fP is full or all
the structure identifiers have been copied.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error detected
by this function.
.IP \fIids\fP
A pointer to a Pint_list structure in which the list of
identifiers of conflicting structures is returned.
The Pint_list structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'num_ints;     'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of integers */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
.IP
The \fInum_ints\fP component specifies the number of structure identifiers
in the list. The \fIints\fP component is a pointer to a list,
\fInum_ints\fP long, of the structure identifiers.
.sp .4
The application must allocate memory for
\fIlength\fP elements in the \fIids\->integers\fP list.
.IP \fItotal_length\fP
A pointer to an integer in which the total number of
conflicting structures is returned.
This is the value required for
\fIlength\fP if all structure identifiers are to be returned.
.SS Execution
If the structure network source is the Central Structure Store,
the identifiers of all structures in the network defined by the
root \fIstructure identifier\fP
in the Central Structure Store are compared to the identifiers of 
\fIall\fP structures in the specified archive file,
and those which are in both are returned as conflicting structures.
If the structure network source is the archive file,
the identifiers of all structures in the network defined by the
root \fIstructure identifier\fP
in the specified archive file are compared to the identifiers of
\fIall\fP structures in the Central Structure Store,
and those which are in both are returned as conflicting structures.
.SH ERRORS
