.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE ARCHIVE FILES\s+2 to determine the names and identifiers of
all currently open archive files.
.SS C Input Parameters
Applications using the \s-2C\s+2 binding must create a buffer to be used by this
function as memory space for storing data associated with the device state.
This buffer is passed as the \fIstore\fP argument.  
.LP
The store buffer is a data area managed by \s-2PHIGS\s+2. While the application 
is responsible for creating the inital buffer through a call to \s-2\CREATE STORE\s+2, 
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 manages this area such that there is sufficient memory for the 
specific inquiry. The data record within the store buffer is accessed 
by the pointer pointed to by \fIar_files\fR.
.IP \fIstore\fP
The memory buffer \s-2PHIGS\s+2 is to use for storing the information
returned.  
This buffer must exist prior to calling this function (see
\s-2CREATE STORE (3P)\s+2).
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error detected
by this function.
.IP \fIar_files\fP
A pointer to a structure Par_file_list,
containing a list of the currently open archive file identifiers and names.
Par_file_list is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +1.0i +1.0i
.nf
typedef struct{
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ar_files;	/* number of archive files */
	Par_file	*ar_files;	/* list of archive files */
.sp .2
} Par_file_list;
.fi
The \fInum_ar_files\fP component specifies the number of currently open archive files.
The \fIar_files\fP component is a pointer to a list, \fInum_ar_files\fP long,
of Par_file structs listing the identifiers and names of currently open archive files.
Par_file is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +1.0i +1.0i
.nf
typedef struct{
.sp .2
	Pint	id;	/* archive file identifier */
	char	*name;	/* archive file name */
.sp .2
} Par_file;
.fi
The \fIid\fP component is the archive file identifier and the \fIname\fP component
is a pointer to a character string giving the file name of the archive file with 
identifier \fIid\fP.
