.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET LINETYPE\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the current linetype attribute.  
When the current linetype \s-2ASF\s+2 (Aspect Source Flag) 
is set to \s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2, the attribute defines the linetype 
to be applied to the following output primitives:

If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, then 
a \s-2SET LINETYPE\s+2 element is inserted into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer.  If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, then the new \s-2SET LINETYPE\s+2 element
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer.  In either case, the
element pointer is updated to point to the new element.  
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIlinetype\fP
An integer value specifying a \fIlinetype\fP;  
the following line types are defined:
.nf
.ta .5i +.5i +1.5i +1i
.sp .2
	1	PLINE_SOLID	\fISolid\fP
	2	PLINE_DASH	\fIDashed\fP
	3	PLINE_DOT	\fIDotted\fP
	4	PLINE_DOT_DASH	\fIDot-dashed\fP
.sp .2
.fi
Support for \fIlinetypes\fP is workstation dependent.
.SS Execution
When the \s-2SET LINETYPE\s+2 element is traversed, the current linetype
entry in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 traversal state list is set to \fIlinetype\fP.  
When the current linetype ASF is set to
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2, line output primitives which follow in
the structure network will be drawn with the \fIlinetype\fP specified.  
.LP
When the current linetype ASF is set to \s-2BUNDLED\s+2,
the effective linetype is
the linetype attribute in the polyline representation selected by
the current polyline index.  
In this case, the \fIlinetype\fP set with \s-2SET LINETYPE\s+2 has no effect.  
.LP
If the \fIlinetype\fP specified is not available on the workstation,
linetype 1 (\fISolid\fP) will be used.
.SH ERRORS

Ignoring function, function requires state
