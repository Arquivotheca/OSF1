.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET VIEW TRANSFORMATION INPUT PRIORITY\s+2
assigns a relative priority to an entry
in the workstation's view table, to be used when transforming
\s-2LOCATOR\s+2 or \s-2STROKE\s+2 operator input coordinates
from Device Coordinates (\s-2DC\s+2) to World Coordinates (\s-2WC\s+2).
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The identifier of the workstation for which the view transformation
input priority is being set.
.IP \fIindex\fP
The priority is being set for this \fIview index\fP.
.IP \fIref_index\fP
The priority of \fIindex\fP is set just higher or lower than
that of this \fIreference view index\fP.
.IP \fIpriority\fP
The \fIrelative priority\fP for \fIindex\fP,
relative to the \fIref_index\fP; one of the enumerated values:

.SS Execution
\s-2SET VIEW TRANSFORMATION INPUT PRIORITY\s+2
assigns a relative priority to a view representation entry
in the workstation's view table, to be used when transforming
\s-2LOCATOR\s+2 or \s-2STROKE\s+2 operator input coordinates 
from \s-2DC\s+2 to \s-2WC\s+2.  The priority of view index is set just
higher or just lower than the priority of the reference view index.
.LP
\s-2LOCATOR\s+2 or \s-2STROKE\s+2 operator input data
are transformed by the inverse viewing pipeline,
from \s-2DC\s+2 to \s-2WC\s+2.
First, the inverse workstation transformation (in effect when the
input is generated) maps the \s-2DC\s+2 values to Normalized Projection
Coordinates (\s-2NPC\s+2), always
resulting in values in the \s-2NPC\s+2 unit cube.
Then, the \s-2NPC\s+2 positions need to be mapped to \s-2WC\s+2 by the inverse
of one of the viewing transformations; the relative priority order
of the viewing transformations is used to determine which viewing
transformation inverse to apply.
.LP
Views with lower priority than view 0's will never be used to
map input data.
View 0 is the identity transformation encompassing the entire \s-2NPC\s+2 space cube
and cannot be changed.  Therefore, any input position is necessarily
in view 0, and lower priority views are effectively disabled.
The initial ordering, when a workstation is opened, gives view number 0
the highest priority, view 1 the next highest, and so on.
All views except 0 are disabled.
.LP
If the view index is the same as the reference view index,
the function has no effect.
.LP
The relative view transformation input priorities may be obtained using
\s-2INQUIRE LIST OF VIEW INDICES\s+2.
