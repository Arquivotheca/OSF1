.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE LIST OF COLOUR INDICES\s+2 to obtain a list of the
currently defined colour indices on the specified workstation.  
The defined colour table indices are \fIconceptually sparse\fP:  
a \s-2PHIGS\s+2 implementation could allow definition of \fIn\fP 
colours with arbitrary indices.  
However, colour indices are \fInonsparse\fP in \s-2PEX-SI\s0:  
the \fIn\fP colour representations necessarily have indices 
0 through \fIn - 1\fP.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
Workstation identifier of the workstation
whose colour indices are to be returned.
.IP \fIlength\fP
Number of items for which the application has allocated memory
in the output parameter indices.  Specify 
0 to get the total length of the list.  
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position in the list at which to begin the inquiry.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
Pointer to the location for storing the error number of any error
this function detects.
.IP \fIindices\fP
A pointer to a Pint_list in which the system returns the portion of the
list of currently defined colour indices,
starting at the entry specified with \fIstart\fP.
Pint_list is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'num_ints;     'u
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of integers */
.fi
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.sp .5
The pointer \fIindices\fR\(->\fIints\fR must be initialized to an array of
\fIlength\fR Pint elements.
.IP \fItotal_length\fP
Pointer to an integer in which to return the total length of
the list.
This is the value required for \fIlength\fR if all the items in the
list are to be returned.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2WSOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, specified workstation is not open
.IP 059
Ignoring function, specified workstation does not have output capability
(in other words, the workstation category is neither 
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
