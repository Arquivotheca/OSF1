.TH "APPLICATION DATA" 3P "16 August 1991"
.SH NAME
APPLICATION DATA \- create a structure element containing application data
.IX "Elements" "APPLICATION DATA"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS C Syntax
.ft B
.ta 1.25i 3i
.nf
void
pappl_data ( data )
Pdata	*data;	\fIapplication data\fP
.fi
.ft R
.SS Required PHIGS Operating States
(PHOP, *, STOP, *)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
The 
\s-2APPLICATION DATA\s+2 
subroutine puts a structure element containing
application data into the currently open structure.
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, the 
\s-2APPLICATION DATA\s+2
element is inserted into the currently open structure after the element
currently pointed to by the element pointer. If the edit mode is
\s-2REPLACE\s+2, the 
\s-2APPLICATION DATA\s+2
element replaces the element pointed
to. In either case, the element pointer is updated to point to the new
\s-2APPLICATION DATA\s+2
element.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIdata \fP
A pointer to a Pdata structure containing the application data.
Pdata is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'void     'u +\w'*data;     'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	size_t	size;	/* size of data */
	void	*data;	/* pointer to data */
.sp .2
} Pdata;
.fi
.sp
The size component specifies the number of bytes the data 
component is pointing to.
.SS Execution
The 
\s-2APPLICATION DATA\s+2
element is ignored during structure traversal.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP\s+2, *, \s-2STOP\s+2, *)
