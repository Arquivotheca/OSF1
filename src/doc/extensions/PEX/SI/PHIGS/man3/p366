.SH NAME
SET POLYMARKER INDEX \- create a structure element containing a polymarker representation index attribute
.IX "Marker Attributes" "SET POLYMARKER INDEX"
.IX "Attributes, Marker Attributes" "SET POLYMARKER INDEX"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS C Syntax
.ft B
.ta 1.25i 3i
.nf

pset_marker_ind ( index )
Pint	index;	\fIpolymarker index\fP
.fi
.ft R
.SS Required PHIGS Operating States
(PHOP, *, STOP, *)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET POLYMARKER INDEX\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a polymarker index number, which selects an entry
from the workstation's polymarker bundle table.
This attribute applies to the output primitives:
.LP
.RS
.nf
\(bu  \s-2POLYMARKER\s+2
\(bu  \s-2POLYMARKER 3\s+2
.RE
.fi
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2,
a \s-2SET POLYMARKER INDEX\s+2 element is inserted into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer. If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2,
the new \s-2SET POLYMARKER INDEX\s+2 element
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer.
In either case, the element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIindex\fP
A \fIpolymarker index\fP for a polymarker representation on the workstation.
.SS Execution
When the \s-2SET POLYMARKER INDEX\s+2 element is traversed,
the `current polymarker index' value is set to the \fIpolymarker index\fP,
which specifies an entry from the workstation's polymarker bundle table.
The default \fIpolymarker index\fP is 1, and
if the \fIpolymarker index\fP specified is not available on the workstation,
1 will be used.
When the ASFs are
.IR INDIVIDUAL ,
the attributes come from the appropriate
.SM SET
.I attribute
elements.
.LP
A polymarker representation contains values for the following attributes:
.sp .2
.nf
.RS
\(bu  marker type
\(bu  marker size scale factor
\(bu  polymarker colour index
.fi
.RE
Polymarker output primitives which follow in the structure network
will be drawn using the values from the specified representation
for those attributes whose Aspect Source Flag \s-2(ASF)\s+2 is set to
\s-2BUNDLED\s+2.
.LP
Polymarker representations are defined with
\s-2SET POLYMARKER REPRESENTATION\s+2.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state \s-2(PHOP, *, STOP, *)\s+2
.IP 100
Ignoring function, the bundle index value is less than one
