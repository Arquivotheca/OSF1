.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2CREATE STORE\s+2 creates a Store object and returns the handle to it.
Store objects are used to hold the return values of complex inquiry
functions.
.SS C Output Parameter
.IP \fIerr\fP
The status of the creation of the new Store.
.IP \fIstore \fP
The handle to the newly created Store.
.SS Execution
\s-2CREATE STORE\s+2 creates a new Store and returns a handle to it
via the \fIstore\fR parameter.
The parameter \fIerr\fR returns the error number of any error detected.
If a zero is returned the creation was successful.
.LP
A Store is an opaque pointer that is passed as a parameter to a function
returning complex data.  A Store contains the memory to hold the results
of a complex inquiry.  A Store may be passed to or used by more than one inquiry
function, but at any one time a Store only holds the result of the last
inquiry function that used it as an argument.
A Store continues to hold the information from the last inquiry function
until it is freed by \s-2DELETE STORE\s+2, or until the Store is used as
an argument to a subsequent inquiry function, in which case the information
is overwritten.
