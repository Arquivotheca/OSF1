.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2RETRIEVE ALL STRUCTURES\s+2 to retrieve all structures
from the specified open archive file into the
Central Structure Store (\s-2CSS\s+2).
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIarchive_id\fP
The archive identifier specifying the open archive file
from which to read.
.SS Execution
All structures in the specified open archive file are copied
into the \s-2CSS\s+2.
If any of the structures to be retrieved currently
exist in the \s-2CSS\s+2, the conflict is resolved as follows:
.sp .5v
.in +0.5i
.ta +0.2i
.ti -0.2i
\(bu	If the retrieval conflict resolution flag is \s-2MAINTAIN\s+2,
then the conflicting structure will not be copied into the \s-2CSS\s+2 
(its contents are maintained).
.sp .5v
.ti -0.2i
\(bu	If the retrieval conflict resolution flag is \s-2UPDATE\s+2,
then the conflicting structure in the \s-2CSS\s+2 will be overwritten
(its contents are updated).
.sp .5v
.ti -0.2i
\(bu	If the retrieval conflict resolution flag is \s-2ABANDON\s+2,
then no structures will be copied to the \s-2CSS\s+2.
.LP
The retrieval conflict resolution flag is set by the
\s-2SET CONFLICT RESOLUTION\s+2
subroutine.
.LP
If the currently open structure must be overwritten
because of a conflict while
the retrieval conflict resolution flag is \s-2UPDATE\s+2,
then it is closed, its contents are
overwritten, and it is re-opened. The element pointer
will be set to point
to the last element.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 007
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2AROP\s+2)
.IP 404
Ignoring function, the specified archive file is not open
.IP 405
Ignoring function, name conflict occurred while conflict resolution flag
has value \s-2ABANDON\s+2
