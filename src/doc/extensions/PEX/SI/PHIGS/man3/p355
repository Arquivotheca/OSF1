.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET PICK FILTER\s+2 sets the \fIpick filter\fP of a \s-2PICK\s+2 input device,
which is compared to the traversal-time \fIcurrent name set\fP of each primitive
to determine if the primitive is pickable by that device.  
.LP
The filter contains an \fIinclusion set\fP and an \fIexclusion set\fP of names.  
During traversal,
a primitive is pickable by the \s-2PICK\s+2 input device
if at least one name in the current name set is in the inclusion set
and no name in the `current name set' is in the exclusion set.  
This means the exclusion set has precedence over the inclusion set.  
Each name in the name set, inclusion set, and exclusion set 
is a small positive integer.  
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The identifier of the workstation.  
.IP \fIdev_num\fP
The device number of the \s-2PICK\s+2 input device on this workstation
whose pick filter is to be set.  
.IP \fIfilter\fP
A pointer to a Pfilter structure containing the inclusion set and exclusion set
of names. Pfilter is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .2
.ta .5i +1i +1.25i
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint_list	incl_set;	/* inclusion set */
	Pint_list	excl_set;	/* exclusion set */
.sp .2
} Pfilter;
.fi
.sp .4
The Pint_list structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .2
.ta .5i +\w'Pint	'u +\w'*num_ints;	'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of integers */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
.sp .4
.SS Execution
\s-2SET PICK FILTER\s+2 sets the \s-2PICK\s+2 input device's pick filter,
which contains an inclusion set and an exclusion set of names,
both empty by default.  
A primitive is pickable by a workstation's \s-2PICK\s+2 input device
if at least one name in the current name set is in the
\s-2PICK\s+2 device's pick filter inclusion set
and no name in the current name set is in the device's
pick filter exclusion set.  
If the device's pick filter inclusion set is empty,
no primitives are pickable by that device.  
.LP
If the current name set is empty, subsequent primitives are not pickable
by any \s-2PICK\s+2 device.  
When the conceptual traversal of a posted structure network
(to determine what primitive is being picked) starts, the current name set
is empty.  During traversal, the member names specified
by the \s-2ADD NAMES TO SET\s+2 element are added to the current name set
by the union operation on the sets;  
\s-2REMOVE NAMES FROM SET\s+2 elements remove names from the current name set.  
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003

(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2WSOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 060
Ignoring function, specified workstation is not of category \s-2OUTIN\s+2
.IP 250
Ignoring function, the specified device is not available
on the specified workstation
