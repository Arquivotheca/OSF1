.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE LIST OF POLYMARKER INDICES\s+2 to obtain a list of the
currently defined polymarker indices on the specified workstation.  
The defined polymarker table indices are \fIconceptually sparse\fP;  
a \s-2PHIGS\s+2
implementation could allow definition of \fIn\fP polymarker representations
with arbitrary indices.
However, polymarker indices are
\fInonsparse\fP in \s-2PEX-SI\s0;  the \fIn\fP polymarker representations
necessarily have indices 1 through \fIn\fP.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The \fIworkstation identifier\fP of the workstation
whose polymarker indices are to be returned.
.IP \fIlength\fP
Number of items for which the application has allocated memory
in the output parameter \fIindices\fP.
0 can be specified, in order to get the total length of the list.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position in the list at which to begin the inquiry.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIindices\fP
A pointer to a Pint_list structure
in which the system returns the portion of the
list of currently defined polymarker indices,
starting at the entry specified with \fIstart\fP.
.IP
Pint_list is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint   'u +\w'num_ints;    'u
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint   num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint   *ints;	/* list of integers */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
.sp .5
The pointer \fIindices\fR\(->\fIints\fP must be initialized to an array of
\fIlength\fP \fIPint\fP elements.
.IP \fItotal_length\fP
A pointer to an integer in which to return the total length of the list.
This is the value required for \fIlength\fP if all the items in the
list are to be returned.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2WSOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(in other words, the workstation category is neither \s-2OUTPUT\s+2,
\s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
