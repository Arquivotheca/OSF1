.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE PATTERN FACILITIES\s+2 to determine
the number of predefined pattern indices available on a
specified workstation type.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fItype\fP
Workstation type.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIpredefined\fP
A pointer to an integer that returns the number of predefined pattern indices
available on workstations of type \fItype\fP.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, *\s+2)
.IP 051
Ignoring function, this information is not yet available
for this workstation type; open a workstation of this type
and use the specific workstation type
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have
output capability (that is, the workstation category is neither
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 062
Ignoring function, this information is not available for this
\s-2MO\s+2 workstation type
