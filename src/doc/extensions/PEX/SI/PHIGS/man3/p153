.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \*f to obtain a list
of the currently available workstation types stored in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2
description table.  This list contains the predefined workstation types
described in \s-2OPEN WORKSTATION\s+2 and user-created workstation types
created with \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE CREATE\s+2.  User-created types are
removed from this list by \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE DESTROY\s+2.  
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIlength\fP
The number of \fIints\fR in the \fItypes\fR output parameter for which the 
application has allocated memory. \fIlength\fR is the number of list elements
that the system can return in \fItypes\(->ints\fR.
If a value of 0 is used here, no data will be returned in the \fItypes\(->ints\fR
list, but the total number of elements will be returned in \fIlength_list\fR.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position of inquiry.  The elements in the list, beginning
with the item number specified by \fIstart\fR, are copied sequentially into 
\fItypes\(->ints\fR until \fItypes\(->ints\fR is full
or all the elements have been copied.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location for storing the error number of any error detected by this
function.  See the \fIErrors\fP section below for possible return values.  
.IP \fItypes\fP
A pointer to a Pint_list structure in which to return the number and list
of available workstation types.
Pint_list is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp
.ta .5i +\w'Pint	'u +\w'num_ints;	'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of Pints */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
.IP
The \fInum_ints\fR component specifies the number of elements in the list.
The \fIints\fR component is a pointer to a list \fInum_ints\fR long.
.IP
The application must allocate memory for \fIlength\fR elements in the
list of \fIints\fR.
.IP \fIlength_list\fP
A pointer to an integer in which the system returns the total number of elements
in the list.  This is the value required for \fIlength\fR if all elements in the
list are to be returned.
.SS Execution
\*f returns the list of available workstation types stored in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2
description table.
See \s-2OPEN WORKSTATION\s+2 and \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE CREATE\s+2 for a
description of the available workstation types and information on how to 
create new ones.
.LP
If this function detects an error, then the \fIerror indicator\fP 
indicates the error number of the detected error and no other output data
is  returned, except in the cases mentioned in the \s-2C\s+2 Parameters 
section above.  
If the function detects no error, then the \fIerror indicator\fP is set to zero 
and the inquired information is available in the output
parameters.  Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not
invoked when this function detects an error.  
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 2200
Buffer overflow in input or inquiry function
