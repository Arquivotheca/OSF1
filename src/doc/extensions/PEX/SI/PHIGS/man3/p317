.SH DESCRIPTION
\s-2SET ERROR HANDLER\s+2 sets the error handling function that will be called when
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 reports an error.
The default function is perr_hand.
See the \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 man page for a description of the parameters passed to
the error handling function.
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2SET ERROR HANDLER\s+2 is used to set the error handling function to an
application's own error handling function.
.LP
When the error handling mode is \s-2ON\s+2, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is
called by \s-2PHIGS\s+2 functions when they detect an error.
.LP
An application may replace the default \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 function,
using this function, in order to modify the default response to errors, which is
simply to call \s-2ERROR LOGGING\s+2.
Any such replacement must have the name above and accept the same parameters.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fInew_err_hand\fP
A function that is to be the new error handling function.
.IP \fIold_err_hand\fP
A pointer to a function pointer where the current error handling function
will be returned.
.SS Execution
\s-2SET ERROR HANDLER\s+2 sets the error handling function that will be called when
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 reports an error.
The error handling function is called by \s-2PHIGS\s+2 when an error is detected in
a non-inquiry function and the error handling mode is \s-2ON\s+2.
.LP
See \s-2OPEN PHIGS\s+2 for a description of the \s-2PHIGS\s+2
interaction with the error file.
