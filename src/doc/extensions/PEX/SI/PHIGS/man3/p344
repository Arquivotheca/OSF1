.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET MARKER TYPE\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the current marker type attribute.
.LP
When the current marker type Aspect Source Flag \s-2(ASF)\s+2
is set to \s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2,
the current value of this attribute
defines the marker type to be applied to the output primitives:

An integer value specifying a marker type;
the following marker types are defined:

Support for marker types is workstation dependent.
.SS Execution
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2,
a \s-2SET MARKER TYPE\s+2 element is inserted into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer. If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the new \s-2SET MARKER TYPE\s+2 element
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer. In either case, the
element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.LP
When the \s-2SET MARKER TYPE\s+2 element is traversed, the current marker
type
entry in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 traversal state list is set to marker type.
.LP
When the current marker type \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2,
\s-2POLYMARKER\s+2 and \s-2POLYMARKER 3\s+2 output primitives which follow in
the structure network are then drawn using the marker type specified.
.LP
The default marker type is 3, \fIAsterisk\fP (\(**).
If the marker type specified is not available on the workstation,
the default will be used.
.LP
When the current marker type \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to \s-2BUNDLED\s+2,
the effective marker type is
the marker type attribute in the polymarker representation selected by
the current polymarker index.
In this case, the marker type set with \s-2SET MARKER
TYPE\s+2 has no effect.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, STOP, *\s+2)
