.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INITIALIZE PICK 3\s+2 to set the initialization parameters of a
\s-2PICK\s+2 device.
This function stores these parameters in the workstation state list
of the workstation associated with the specified device.
The specified \fBdevice must be in \s-2REQUEST\s+2 mode\fP when this
function is called.
.LP
The \fIpick filter\fP of a \s-2PICK\s+2 device controls which output
primitives on the device's workstation are pickable.
By default no output primitives are pickable.
See \s-2SET PICK FILTER\s+2 for more information on the pick filter.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The workstation identifier of the workstation associated with the device.
.IP \fIdev\fP
The device number of the \s-2PICK\s+2 device to initialize.
See the \fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section below for a description of the
available devices.
.IP \fIistat\fP
The \s-2PICK\s+2 status of the initial measure.
Pin_status is an enumerated type defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i
.nf
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PIN_STATUS_NONE,
	PIN_STATUS_OK,
	PIN_STATUS_NO_IN
.sp .2
} Pin_status;
.fi
.IP \fIinit\fP
A pointer to a Ppick_path structure containing the initial pick path, if any.
This value is ignored if \fIstatus\fP is not \s-2PIN_STATUS_OK\s+2.
Ppick_path is defined in phigs.h as:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Ppick_path_elem     'u +\w'*pick_path;     'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	depth;	/* pick path_list depth */
	Ppick_path_elem	*path_list;	/* pick path */
.sp .2
} Ppick_path;
.fi
.sp
.IP
The depth indicates the number of elements in the path.
.IP
\fIpath_list\fR is the array of path elements defining the location of the
primitive in the \s-2CSS\s+2.
Ppick_path_elem is defined in phigs.h as:
.bp
.ta .5i +1i  +1i
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	struct_id;	/* structure identifier */
	Pint	pick_id;	/* hierarchical pick identifier */
	Pint	elem_pos;	/* element sequence number */
.sp .2
} Ppick_path_elem;
.fi
.IP
The struct_id, pick_id, and elem_pos
are the structure identifier, pick id, and element number, respectively,
of each element in the path.
.IP \fIpet\fP
The prompt/echo type desired.
Those supported by each device are listed in the
\fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section below.
.IP \fIecho_volume\fP
A pointer to a Plimit3 structure spedifying the echo volume, in Device Coordinates.
Plimit3 is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +1i  +1i
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	x_min;	/* minimum x coordinate value */
	Pfloat	x_max;	/* maximum x coordinate value */
	Pfloat	y_min;	/* minimum y coordinate value */
	Pfloat	y_max;	/* maximum y coordinate value */
	Pfloat	z_min;	/* minimum z coordinate value */
	Pfloat	z_max;	/* maximum z coordinate value */
.sp .2
} Plimit3;
.fi
.IP \fIrecord\fP
A pointer to a Ppick_data3 union containing the data record information.
The contents of the data record for each device and prompt/echo type are
described below in the \fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section.
.IP
The members of the data record union correspond to the prompt/echo type
being used.
As an example, the appropriate member of the Ppick_data3 union for
prompt/echo type 1 is
\fIpet_r1\fP.
.IP
For some prompt/echo types the data record is not used; however,
the record parameter must still be specified.
.IP \fIorder\fP
The pick path order of paths returned by
\s-2REQUEST PICK\s+2, \s-2GET PICK\s+2, and \s-2SAMPLE PICK\s+2.
Ppath_order is an enumerated type defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i
.nf
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PORDER_TOP_FIRST,
	PORDER_BOTTOM_FIRST
.sp .2
} Ppath_order;
.fi
.IP
If the order is \s-2TOP FIRST\s+2, the structure specified in any
pick path element is a parent of the structure specified in the subsequent
pick path element.
If the order is \s-2BOTTOM FIRST\s+2, the structure specified in any
pick path element is a child of the structure specified in the subsequent
pick path element.
.SS Execution
.LP
\s-2INITIALIZE PICK 3 \s+2 sets the initialization parameters of a
\s-2PICK\s+2 device.
This function stores these parameters in the workstation description table
of the workstation associated with the specified device.
The specified device must be in \s-2REQUEST\s+2 mode when this
function is called.
.LP
The parameters that are initialized by this function are the
\fIinitial path\fP,
\fIprompt/echo type\fP,
\fIecho volume\fP,
and
\fIinput data record\fP.
.LP
The \fIinitial path\fP is the logical input value the device will take on
whenever it is enabled.
The device's measure retains this value until operator input changes it.
A device is enabled when the appropriate \s-2REQUEST\s+2 function is called,
or when its input mode is set to \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 or \s-2EVENT\s+2.
.LP
A \s-2PICK\s+2 device measure consists of a \fIstatus\fP and a
\fIpick path\fP.
Status indicates whether or not an initial pick path is specified.
The pick path, if any, describes the location of a picked primitive
in the Central Structure Store (\s-2CSS\s+2).
.LP
The \fIpick filter\fP of a \s-2PICK\s+2 device controls which output
primitives on the device's workstation are pickable.
By default no output primitives are pickable.
See \s-2SET PICK FILTER\s+2 for more information on the pick filter.
.LP
The \fIprompt/echo type\fP determines how the device will be presented to
the operator and respond to his actions.
Each device supports one or more prompt/echo types.
Those supported by each device are listed in the device's
description in the \fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section below.
All devices support prompt/echo type 1.
Positive prompt/echo types are defined by the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 standard.
Negative types are implementation-dependent.
.LP
The \fIecho volume\fP defines the region of the display surface in which to
echo the device.
It is specified in Device Coordinates (\s-2DC\s+2).
Devices that use the echo volume may restrict their display to this region.
Some of these devices may still recognize operator input
outside the region even though they don't display there.
.LP
The \fIinput data record\fP contains the prompt/echo type specific
information that controls the device's appearance and characteristics.
Not all the data record contents are used by some devices.
The device descriptions in the \fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section below
list the data record contents that each device recognizes.
.LP
All the initialization parameters must be specified properly or this function
will generate an error.
The \fIERRORS\fP section below lists the possible error conditions.
.LP
The default initialization parameters and the list of prompt/echo types
supported by a \s-2PICK\s+2 input device can be inquired with the function
\s-2INQUIRE DEFAULT PICK DEVICE DATA 3\s+2.
The current state of the device can be inquired with the function
\s-2INQUIRE PICK DEVICE STATE 3\s+2.
.SH AVAILABLE DEVICES
.SS Device 1 - "Pointer device"
.LP
This device is associated with the X pointer device.
The operator picks an output primitive by selecting a displayed primitive
with the pointer.
.LP
When a pick is attempted by the operator,
\s-2PHIGS\s0 searches the workstation's list of posted structures for
visible and pickable output primitives that intersect a \s-2\&3D\s+2
region around the pointer.
This region is called the pick \fIaperture\fP.
The search starts at the root of the posted structure network with highest
priority and continues until the entire network has been traversed.
The \fBlast\fP pickable primitive in this network that intersects the
aperture is the picked primitive.
If no such primitive is found, the search continues with the next highest
priority structure network until a primitive is found or there are no more
structure networks to search.
.LP
If no pickable primitive is found to intersect the aperture,
the \s-2PICK\s+2 device measure status is set to \s-2PIN_STATUS_NONE\s+2.  
.LP
This device does not use the echo volume.
.LP
Only prompt/echo type 1 is supported.
.LP
Picking is only supported for X servers that support the full PEX
extension.
