.SH DESCRIPTION
\s-1SET PATTERN REPRESENTATION\s+2 sets a pattern attribute bundle on a workstation.
.\" END FORTRAN IF-ELSE
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET PATTERN REPRESENTATION\s+2 sets a
pattern attribute bundle on a workstation.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The identifier of the workstation.
.IP \fIindex\fP
This is an index to the workstation pattern bundle table.
.IP \fIrep\fP
A pointer to a Ppat_rep structure.  Ppat_rep is defined as:
.sp .2
.nf
.ta .5i +1i  +1.25i   +1.25i
.sp .2
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint_size	dims;	/* pattern's dimensions */
	Pint	*colr_array;	/* array of colours */
.sp .2
} Ppat_rep;
.fi
.IP
Pint_size is defined as:
.sp .2
.nf
.ta .5i +1i +1i
.sp .2
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	size_x;	/* dimension (number of divisions) along X */
	Pint	size_y;	/* dimension (number of divisions) along Y */
.sp .2
} Pint_size;
.fi
.SS Execution
In the pattern table of the workstation state list, the given
index is associated with the specified parameters.
.LP
A grid of \fI\s-2DX\s+2\fP by  \fI\s-2DY\s+2\fP cells is specified with 
\fI\s-2DX\s+2\fP
being horizontal and \fI\s-2DY\s+2\fP being vertical. 
The colour is given individually for each cell
by the colour index, which is an index into the colour table of 
the workstation. 
.LP
If the workstation supports interior style \s-2PATTERN\s+2, the pattern
table in the workstation state list has predefined entries taken from
the workstation description table. A number of these entries are predefined
for every workstation of category \s-2OUTPUT\s+2 and \s-2OUTIN\s+2
supporting interior style \s-2PATTERN\s+2. Any table entry, including
the predefined entries, may be redefined with this function.
.LP
When area-defining primitives are displayed during structure traversal,
if the currently selected interior style is \s-2PATTERN\s+2, the current
or back interior style index in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2
state list
refers to an entry in the pattern table.
The selection is made either via the interior bundle
or individually, depending on the
corresponding Aspect Source Flags(\s-2ASF\s+2s). If the
current or back interior style index is not present in the 
pattern table, then interior style index one is used. If interior style
index one is not present, the result is workstation dependent and the
interior style \s-2PATTERN\s+2 is not supported for this workstation.
The setting of the corresponding \s-2ASF\s+2s determines which 
aspects in the entry are used.
.LP
During structure traversal, if a pattern colour index specified
in the pattern colour array is not available on the workstation,
then colour index one is used.
.RE
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, WSOP, *, *\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(in other words, the workstation category is neither 
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 103
Ignoring function, setting this bundle table entry would exceed
the maximum number of entries allowed in the workstation bundle table
.IP 112
Ignoring function, the pattern index value is less than one
.IP 113
Ignoring function, the colour index value is less than zero
.IP 116
Ignoring function, one of the dimensions of pattern colour array
is less than one
