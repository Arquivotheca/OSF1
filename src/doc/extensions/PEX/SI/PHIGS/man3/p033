.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2DELETE STORE\s+2 destroys the specified Store object and frees all
memory associated with it.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIstore \fP
The Store to be deleted.
.SS Execution
\s-2DELETE STORE\s+2 frees all memory associated with a Store.
A Store is an opaque pointer that is passed as a parameter to a function
returning complex data.  A Store contains the memory to hold the results
of a complex inquiry.  A Store may be passed to or used by more than one inquiry
function, but at any one time a Store only holds the result of the last
inquiry function that used it as an argument.
A Store continues to hold the information from the last inquiry function
until it is freed by \s-2DELETE STORE\s+2, or until the Store is used as
an argument to a subsequent inquiry function, in which case the information
is overwritten.
