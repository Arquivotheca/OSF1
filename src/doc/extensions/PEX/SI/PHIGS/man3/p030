.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2DELETE ELEMENT\s+2 deletes the structure element currently pointed to by the element pointer in the open structure.
.SS C Input Parameters
None
.SS Execution
The \s-2DELETE ELEMENT\s+2 subroutine removes the structure element currently pointed to by the element pointer in the open structure and renumbers the remaining elements in the structure to maintain a consecutive, ascending order in the structure.
.sp
When the element is deleted, the element pointer is set to point to the element preceding the deleted element in the structure.
.sp
If the element pointer is 0 (pointing to the position in the structure before any elements) when \s-2DELETE ELEMENT\s+2 is called, the subroutine will not delete any element and will not adjust the element pointer.
.SH ERRORS
