.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2INQUIRE HLHSR IDENTIFIER FACILITIES\s+2 obtains the available \s-2HLHSR\s+2
(hidden line and hidden surface removal) identifiers 
on the specified workstation type.  See \s-2SET HLHSR IDENTIFIER\s+2  
for a description of how to set the id.
.sp .3
.IP \fItype \fP
Type of workstation.
.IP \fIlength\fP
The number of \fIints\fR in the \fIids\fR output parameter for which the 
application has allocated memory. \fIlength\fR is the number of list elements
that the system can return in \fIids\(->ints\fR.
If a value of 0 is used here, no data will be returned in the \fIids\(->ints\fR
list, but the total number of identifiers in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 state list
will be returned in \fIlength_list\fR.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position of inquiry into the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 state list of 
current identifiers. The elements of the list of identifiers, beginning
with the item number specified by \fIstart\fR, are copied sequentially into 
\fIids\(->ints\fR until \fIids\(->ints\fR is full or all the 
identifiers have been copied.
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIids\fP
A pointer to a Pint_list data structure in which the system returns a 
list of the \s-2HLHSR\s+2 identifiers available on this workstation type. 
The returned list starts with the \fIstart\fP item in the list of 
identifiers and returns the next \fIlength\fP items. 
Pint_list is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.ta .5i +\w'Pint   'u +\w'num_ints;   'u
.nf
.sp .3
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;		/* number of identifiers in list */
	Pint	*ints;		/* list of identifiers */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
.IP
Prior to calling this function, the \fIints\fR field must contain 
a pointer to an application supplied buffer.
This buffer must be able to hold \fIlength\fR \fIids\fR.
\fInum_ints\fR is the number of \fIids\fR returned in the buffer.
.sp .2
Defined \fIids\fR are:
.nf
.ta .5i +.25i +2i +.25i
.sp .2
	0	PHIGS_HLHSR_ID_OFF	\fIDo not do Hidden Line or Hidden Surface removal\fP
	1	PHIGS_HLHSR_ID_ON	\fIDo Hidden Line and Hidden Surface removal 
				according to the current \s-2HLHSR\s+2 Mode\s+2\fP  
.fi
.sp .3
.IP \fIlength_list\fP
A pointer to an integer in which the system returns the total number of elements
in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 state list of currently used identifiers.
This is the value required for \fIlength\fR if all identifiers are to be returned.
