.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET INTERIOR STYLE\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the current interior style attribute.
.LP
When the current interior style Aspect Source Flag (\s-2ASF\s+2) is set to
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2,
the current value of this attribute
defines the interior style to be applied to the following output primitives:

All of the following data types are predefined in phigs.h.
.IP \fIstyle\fP
An enumerated value specifying one of the following interior styles:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'PSTYLE_HOLLOW,     'u
.nf
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PSTYLE_HOLLOW,	\fIHollow\fP
	PSTYLE_SOLID,	\fISolid\fP
	PSTYLE_PAT,	\fIPatterned\fP
	PSTYLE_HATCH,	\fIHatched\fP
	PSTYLE_EMPTY	\fIEmpty\fP
.sp .2
} Pint_style;
.fi
.SS Execution
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, a
\s-2SET INTERIOR STYLE\s+2 
element is inserted into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer. If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the new
\s-2SET INTERIOR STYLE\s+2
element
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer. In either case, the
element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.LP
When the 
\s-2SET INTERIOR STYLE\s+2
element is encountered during
traversal, the current interior style
entry in the traversal state list is set to the specified
interior style.
.LP
When the current interior style \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2, area-defining output primitives which follow in
the structure network are filled using the current interior style. The interior styles have the following meanings:
.IP \fIHollow\fP 1i
No filling, but draw the bounding polyline using the colour specified by
the interior colour index.
This is the default style and is also used if
an interior style is specified that is not available on the workstation.
.IP \fISolid\fP  1i
Fill the interior using the colour specified by the interior colour index.
.IP \fIPatterned\fP 1i
Fill the interior using the interior style index as an index into the
workstation pattern table.  See 
\s-2SET PATTERN REPRESENTATION\s+2.
.IP \fIHatched\fP 1i
Fill the interior using the colour specified by the interior colour index
and the interior style index as an index into the
workstation table of available hatches.
Hatches are predefined; they cannot be defined by the application.
.IP \fIEmpty\fP   1i
No filling, but draw the edges in accordance with the edge flag.
\s-2FILL AREA\s+2
and 
\s-2FILL AREA 3\s+2
primitives will be invisible,
but could still be pickable.
See
\s-2SET EDGE FLAG\s+2
for more information.
.LP
When the current interior style \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to \s-2BUNDLED\s+2,
the interior style is taken from the
workstation representation indicated by the current interior index.
In this case, the interior style
set with \s-2SET INTERIOR STYLE\s+2 has no effect.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2STOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
