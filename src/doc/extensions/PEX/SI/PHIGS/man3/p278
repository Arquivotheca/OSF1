.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2SAMPLE VALUATOR\s+2 to sample the current measure of the specified
valuator device without waiting for input from the operator. The device
must be in \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 mode.
See \s-2SET VALUATOR MODE\s+2 and \s-2INITIALIZE VALUATOR\s+2 for more information.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
Workstation identifier. An integer specifying the workstation with which
the specified valuator device is associated.
.IP \fIdev\fP
The device number of the valuator device to be sampled.
See the \fIAvailable Devices\fP section of \s-2INITIALIZE VALUATOR\s+2
for a description of the available devices.
.SS C Output Parameter
.IP \fIvalue\fP
A pointer to a Pfloat variable in which to store the \s-2VALUATOR\s+2 measure.
.SS Execution
\s-2SAMPLE VALUATOR\s+2 samples the specified valuator device. The
device must be in \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 mode.
See \s-2SET VALUATOR MODE\s+2 and \s-2INITIALIZE VALUATOR\s+2 for more
information.
.LP
When a device is set to \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 mode, a measure process is created
for the device and the device is activated. When \s-2SAMPLE VALUATOR\s+2 is
called, the current value of the measure process for the specified device
is retrieved without waiting for further input from the operator.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, WSOP, *, *\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 061
Ignoring function, specified workstation is neither of category \s-2INPUT\s+2
nor of category \s-2OUTIN\s+2
.IP 250
Ignoring function, the specified device is not available
on the specified workstation
.IP 252
Ignoring function, the function requires the input device to be in \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 mode
