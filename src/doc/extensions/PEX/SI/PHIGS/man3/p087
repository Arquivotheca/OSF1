.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2INQUIRE ALL CONFLICTING STRUCTURES\s+2 obtains a list of the
identifiers of all structures which exist in both the Central Structure
Store and the specified open archive file.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIar_id\fP
The archive identifier specifying the open archive file to use.
.IP \fIlength\fP
The number of \fIints\fP items in the \fIids\fP output parameter for
which the application has allocated memory.
\fIlength\fP is the number of list elements (structure identifiers)
that the system can return in \fIints\fP.
If a value of 0 is used here, no data will be returned in the
\fIints\fP list, but the
total number of conflicting structures will be returned in \fItotal_length\fP.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position in the list of identifiers of conflicting structures
at which to begin the inquiry.
The elements of the list of structure identifiers, beginning
with the item number specified by \fIstart\fP, are copied sequentially
into \fIints\fP until \fIints\fP is full or all
the structure identifiers have been copied.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error detected
by this function.
.IP \fIids\fP
A pointer to a Pint_list structure in which the list of
identifiers of conflicting structures is returned.
The Pint_list structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'*num_ints;     'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of integers */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
.sp
The \fInum_ints\fP component specifies the number of structure identifiers
in the list. The \fIints\fP component is a pointer to a list,
\fInum_ints\fP long, of the structure identifiers.
.sp
The application must allocate memory for \fIlength\fP elements in
the \fIints\fP list.
.IP \fItotal_length\fP
A pointer to an integer in which the total number of
conflicting structures is returned.
This is the value required for
\fIlength\fP if all structure identifiers are to be returned.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 007
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, AROP\s+2)
.IP 404
Ignoring function, the specified archive file is not open
