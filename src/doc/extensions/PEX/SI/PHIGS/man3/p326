.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET INDIVIDUAL ASF\s+2 creates a structure element
containing the Aspect Source Flag (\s-2ASF\s+2) value
for a specified output primitive attribute.
The \s-2ASF\s+2 setting for each attribute determines if the
value used for that attribute is taken from a defined attribute bundle
(for example, from the polymarker representation selected by the current 
polymarker index) or from an attribute value defined individually
(for example, from the current marker type set by 
\s-2SET MARKER TYPE (3P)\s+2).
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2,
the structure element created is inserted into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer. If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the new \s-2SET INDIVIDUAL ASF\s+2
element replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer. 
In either case, the
element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIatt_id\fP
An enumerated attribute identifier value specifying the attribute
for which the \s-2ASF\s+2 is to be set.  Possible values are:

.sp .2
} Paspect;
.fi
.IP \fIatt_source\fP
An enumerated \s-2ASF\s+2 value specifying the source that should be
used for the attribute identifier or \fIatt_id\fP.
Values defined are:
.nf
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'BUNDLED,     'u
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PASF_BUNDLED,
	PASF_INDIV
.sp .2
} Pasf;
.fi
.SS Execution
When the \s-2SET INDIVIDUAL ASF\s+2 element is encountered during
traversal, the \s-2ASF\s+2 entry in the traversal state list 
for the attribute identifier is set to the \s-2ASF\s+2 value.
.LP
The current setting of the \s-2ASF\s+2 for an attribute determines whether the
current value of that attribute is taken from an attribute bundle or from an
individually specified value set by the appropriate 
\s-2SET INDIVIDUAL ASF\s+2 attribute function.
.LP
For example, when the current text font \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2, the value of the current text font (as set by
\s-2SET TEXT FONT\s+2) is used for text output primitives.
When the current text font \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to \s-2BUNDLED\s+2,
the text font from the workstation's text representation
indicated by the current text index is used instead.
.SH ERRORS
