.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
The \s-2POLYMARKER 3\s+2 function puts the full specification of a \s-2
POLYMARKER 3\s+2 primitive into the currently open structure.  A
\s-2POLYMARKER 3\s+2 primitive is a series of markers, such as dots, plus
signs, asterisks, circles, or \fIx\fP's drawn in the display at the specified
Modelling Coordinate (\s-2MC\s+2) points.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIpoint_list\fP
A pointer to a Ppoint_list3 structure containing a list Ppoint3 structures, which contain the
\fIx\fP and \fIy\fP coordinates for each point at which markers will be placed.
The Ppoint_list3 structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Ppoint3     'u +\w'num_points;     'u 
.nf
typedef struct  {
.sp .2
        Pint    num_points;     /* number of Ppoint3 elements in the list */
        Ppoint3  *points;        /* list of points */
.sp .2
} Ppoint_list3;
.sp .4
.fi
The \fInum_points\fR component specifies the number of elements in the list.
The \fIpoints\fR component is a pointer to a list of Ppoint3s \fInum_points\fR long.
The Ppoint3 structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pfloat     'u +\w'x;     'u
.nf
typedef struct  {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	x;	/* x coordinate */
	Pfloat	y;	/* y coordinate */
	Pfloat	z;	/* z coordinate */
.sp .2
} Ppoint3;
.fi
.SS Execution
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, the \s-2POLYMARKER 3\s+2
element is inserted in the open structure after the element pointed at by
the element pointer. If the current edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the
\s-2POLYMARKER\s+2 element replaces the element pointed at by the element
pointer.  In either case, the element pointer is updated to point to the
new \s-2POLYMARKER 3\s+2 element.
.LP
When the structure is traversed, the \s-2POLYLINE 3\s+2 element places a
marker at each of the coordinate locations specified. The current values
of the attributes listed below will be applied to the marker.
.LP
The marker positions are specified in Model Coordinates (\s-2MC\s+2).
These coordinates can be any coordinate units that are convenient to the application.
At traversal, these coordinate values are transformed by the current local
and global modelling transformations, the view representation selected by the
current view index, and the workstation transformation current on the workstation to
which the structure is posted.
.\"See Chapter 7, "The Transformation
.\"Pipeline," in the \fI\s-2PEX-SI\s0 Programming Guide\fP for more information.
.SS Attributes Applied
The attributes listed below are used to display the
\s-2POLYMARKER 3\s+2 primitive when the structure is traversed. The Aspect Source 
Flags (\s-2ASF\s+2s) tell where to access the output display attributes. 
These attributes can come directly from the traversal state list,
or they can be accessed indirectly, using the appropriate index 
in the traversal state list and the corresponding bundled 
representation in the PHIGS workstation state list.
