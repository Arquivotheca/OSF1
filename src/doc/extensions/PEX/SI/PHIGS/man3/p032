.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2DELETE ELEMENTS BETWEEN LABELS\s+2 to delete structure elements in the open structure between two specified labels. The elements containing the labels are not deleted.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIlabel1_id \fP
The subroutine begins deleting structures with the structure element immediately following this label.
.IP \fIlabel2_id \fP
The subroutine ends deleting structures with the structure element immediately preceding this label.
.SS Execution
The \s-2DELETE ELEMENTS BETWEEN LABELS\s+2 subroutine removes all the elements in the open structure between the two specified labels. The remaining elements are renumbered and the element pointer is updated to point to label 1 identifier.
.sp
The subroutine searches for the specified labels only from the current position of the element pointer in the structure to the end of the structure. The next occurrence of an element containing label 1 identifier is first found; then, starting from the element containing label 1 identifier, the next occurrence of an element containing label 2 identifier is found.
.sp
If either of the label identifiers cannot be found between the current position of the element pointer and the end of the structure, no elements are deleted and an error is generated.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, STOP, *\s+2)
.IP 206
Ignoring function, one or both of the labels does not exist
in the open structure between the element pointer and the end of the structure
