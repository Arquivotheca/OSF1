.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2OPEN ARCHIVE FILE\s+2 to open an archive file and associate a
specified archive file identifier with the open archive file.  
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIarchive_id\fP
An integer specifying the identifier to be associated with the open
archive file.  
.IP \fIarchive_file\fP
A character string giving the file name of the archive file.  The
application should not open this file;  \s-2PHIGS\s+2 will do this when it
needs to access the file.  
.IP
Neither the application nor the operator should attempt to interact with
this file after passing it to \s-2OPEN ARCHIVE FILE\s+2.  
.SS Execution
If the specified archive file does not exist, then a new file is 
created and remains empty until \s-2CLOSE ARCHIVE FILE\s+2 is
called.  At that time, any archived structures will be written to
the file.  
.LP
If the specified file exists and is a valid \s-2PEX-SI\s0 archive file,
the contents are read and available for retrieval.  If the named
file exists but is empty, it is treated as if it did not exist 
(in other words, it becomes a valid \s-2PEX-SI\s0 archive file and remains 
empty until it is closed, at which time any archived structures are written to it).  
.LP
The physical file is opened only by \s-2PHIGS\s+2 when reading from or writing
to it (in other words, during calls to \s-2OPEN ARCHIVE\s+2 and \s-2CLOSE
ARCHIVE\s+2).
.LP
The \s-2PHIGS\s+2 archive state is set to \fIarchive open\fP (\s-2AROP\s+2),
and the specified archive file identifier is added to the
\fIset of open archive files\fP maintained in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 state list.  
.LP
\fBNote:\fP  It is recommended that the application leave an archive file open
until it is no longer needed, in order to avoid repeating the
overhead associated with the \s-2OPEN ARCHIVE FILE\s+2 operation.
.LP
One archive file format is supported: a private \fIbinary\fP format.
The binary format is supported for users who want compact archives over
standard conformance.  
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 402
Ignoring function, archive file identifier already in use
.IP 400
Ignoring function, the archive file cannot be opened
.IP 401
Ignoring function, opening this archive file would exceed the maximum number
of simultaneously open archive files
.IP 403
Ignoring function, the archive file is not a \s-2PHIGS\s+2 archive file
