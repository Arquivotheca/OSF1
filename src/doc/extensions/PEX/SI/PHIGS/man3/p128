.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE EDGE FACILITIES\s+2 to obtain a list of the edge facilities available for the specified type of workstation.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fItype\fP
Workstation type.
.IP \fIlength\fP
The number of elements for which the application has allocated memory
in the output parameter list of integers.
If a value of zero is used, no data will be returned in this list, but the 
total number of elements in the workstation list of available edge types
will be returned in \fItotal_length\fP.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position in the list of available edge types in the workstation
description table at which to begin the inquiry.
The elements of the workstation list of available edge types, beginning
with the item number specified by \fIstart\fP, are copied sequentially
into the list of integers until it is full or all
the items on the workstation list have been copied.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIfacilities\fP
A pointer to a Pedge_facs structure in which the system returns a list
of the edge facilities available for the specified workstation type.
Pedgefac is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.nf
.ta .5i +1.0i +1.25i
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint_list	types;	/* list of edge types */
	Pint	num_widths;	/* number of available edge widths */
	Pfloat	nom_width;	/* nominal edge width */
	Pfloat	min_width;	/* minimum edge width */
	Pfloat	max_width;	/* maximum edge width */
	Pint	num_pred_inds;	/* number of predefined bundles */
.sp .2
} Pedge_facs;
.fi
.sp
And Pint_list is defined as follows:
.sp .4
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'*num_ints;     'u
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of integers */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
.sp
The application must allocate memory for \fIlength\fP elements in the
list of integers.
.IP \fItotal_length\fP
A pointer to an integer in which the system returns the total number of
items in the list of available edge types. This is the value required for
\fIlength\fP if all the items on the workstation list are to be
returned.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, *\s+2)
.IP 051
Ignoring function, this information is not yet available
for this workstation type; open a workstation of this type
and use the specific workstation type
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have
output capability (that is, the workstation category is neither 
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 062
Ignoring function, this information is not available for this
\s-2MO\s+2 workstation type
