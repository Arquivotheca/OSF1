.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2INQUIRE MODELLING CLIPPING FACILITIES\s+2 obtains the number
of planes and available operators
that may be used to determine the modelling clipping volume in the
\s-2PHIGS\s+2
implementation.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIlength\fP
Number of items for which the application has allocated memory
in the output parameter \fIops\fP.
0 can be specified, in order to get the \fItotal length\fP of the list
of operators.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position in the list of operators at which to begin the inquiry.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fInum\fP
A pointer to a location in which the system return the number of distinct
planes (half-spaces) that can be used
to determine the modelling clipping volume.
.IP \fIops\fP
A pointer to a \fIPint_list\fP
in which the system returns the portion of the
list of supported modelling clipping operators,
starting at the entry specified with \fIstart\fP.
.IP
Pint_list is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint   'u +\w'num_ints;    'u
.sp .3
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint   num_ints;		/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint   *ints;		/* list of integers */
.fi
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.sp .5
The pointer \fIops\fR\(->\fIints\fR must be initialized to an array of
\fIlength\fP \fIPint\fP elements.
.IP \fItotal_length\fP
A pointer to an integer in which to return the \fItotal length\fP of
the list of supported operators.
This is the value required for \fIlength\fP if all the items in the
list are to be returned.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
