.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE POLYLINE REPRESENTATION\s+2 to determine the current attribute
values for a specified entry in a specified workstation's table of
defined polyline representations.
.LP
See the description of the subroutine \s-2SET POLYLINE REPRESENTATION\s+2 for information on the meaning of these attribute values.
.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
Workstation identifier.
.IP \fIindex\fP
Entry to be returned from the workstation's table of polyline representations;
if this entry is not present in the table and the
\fItype of returned value\fP parameter is \s-2REALIZED\s+2,
the representation for polyline index 1 is returned.
.IP \fItype\fP
An enumerated value specifying whether the inquired values are to be returned
as the values originally specified by the application (\s-2SET\s+2),
or as the values actually being used by the workstation
if any of the application-specified values
had to be mapped to ones available on the workstation (\s-2REALIZED\s+2).
Valid values are defined in phigs.h as:
.sp
.ta .5i +\w'PINQ_REALIZED     'u
.nf
	PINQ_SET	\fIreturn application-specified value\fP
	PINQ_REALIZED	\fIreturn value available on the workstation\fP
.fi
.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIrep\fP
A pointer to a Pline_bundle structure in which the system returns the
polyline representation at \fIindex\fP in the workstation's table of 
polyline representations.
Pline_bundle is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pfloat     'u +\w'colr_ind;     'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	type;	/* line type */
	Pfloat	width;	/* linewidth scale factor */
	Pint	colr_ind;	/* colour index */
.sp .2
} Pline_bundle;
.fi
.IP
Values for \fItype\fR are:
.ta .5i +.5i 
.nf
	1	PLINE_SOLID
	2	PLINE_DASH
	3	PLINE_DOT
	4	PLINE_DOT_DASH
.fi
.SS Execution
.LP
If the inquired information is available, the error indicator is returned
as zero and the requested information is returned in the output parameters.
.LP
If the specified polyline index is not present in the polyline bundle table
on the workstation and the specified type of returned value is \fIRealized\fP,
the representation for polyline index one is returned.
.LP
If the inquired information is not available, the values returned in the
output parameters are undefined and the error indicator is set to one of
the below error numbers to indicate the reason for non-availability.
.LP
Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not invoked
when an error is detected by this function.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2WSOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(in other words, the workstation category is neither 
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 100
Ignoring function, the bundle index value is less than one
.IP 101
Ignoring function, the specified representation has not been defined
