.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET LINEWIDTH SCALE FACTOR \s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the \fIcurrent linewidth scale factor\fP attribute.
When the \fIlinewidth scale factor ASF\fP is set to \s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2,
this attribute defines the current linewidth to be applied to the
output primitives:

If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2,
a \s-2SET LINEWIDTH SCALE FACTOR\s+2 element is inserted into the
currently open structure after the element pointed to by the current
element pointer. If the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the new \s-2SET
LINEWIDTH SCALE FACTOR\s+2 element replaces the element pointed to by the
element pointer. In either case, the element pointer is updated to point
to the new element.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIwidth\fP
A real value specifying the \fIlinewidth scale factor\fP.
.SS Execution
.LP
When the \s-2SET LINEWIDTH SCALE FACTOR\s+2 element is traversed, the \fIcurrent linewidth scale factor\fP
entry in the traversal state list is set to \fIlinewidth scale factor\fP.
When the \fIcurrent linewidth scale factor \s-2ASF\s+2\fP (Aspect Source Flag) is set to
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2, line output primitives that follow in
the structure network are drawn using the \fIlinewidth scale factor\fP
specified.
.LP
The width of the line drawn is determined by applying the current linewidth
scale factor to the \fInominal linewidth\fP
as defined in the workstation description table,
and this result is then mapped to the nearest linewidth
supported on the workstation.
.LP
When the \fIcurrent linewidth scale factor ASF\fP
is set to \s-2BUNDLED\s+2, the effective
linewidth scale factor is
the linewidth attribute in the polyline representation selected by
the \fIcurrent polyline index\fP.
In this case, the \fIlinewidth scale factor\fP value set with \s-2SET
LINEWIDTH SCALE FACTOR\s+2 will have no effect.
