.SS Execution
In the text bundle table of the workstation state list, the given
index is associated with the specified parameters.
.LP
The text precision value determines the fidelity with which the other
aspects are used. The values of text precision, in order of increasing
fidelity, are \s-2STRING, CHAR,\s+2 and \s-2STROKE\s+2. During structure
traversal, if the specified text precision is not available on a 
workstation, the value \s-2STRING\s+2 is used on that workstation.
.LP
The character expansion factor specifies the deviation of the width
to height ratio of the characters from the ratio indicated by the
font designer. During structure traversal, only the magnitude of the
character expansion factor is considered. If the result of taking the
absolute value of the character expansion factor value is less than
the smallest supported character expansion factor on a workstation,
the smallest supported character expansion factor on that workstation
is used.
.LP
Character spacing specifies how much additional space is inserted
between two adjacent character bodies. Character spacing is specified
as a fraction of the font-nominal character height.
.LP
Text colour is a general colour, either an indirect or a
direct colour in a specified colour model. If an indirect colour is
specified and the specified colour index is not available during
structure traversal, then colour index one is used.
.LP
The extended text bundle table in the workstation state list has
predefined entries taken from the workstation description table. A
number of these entries are predefined for every workstation of category
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2 or \s-2OUTIN\s+2. Any table entry, including the predefined
entries, may be redefined with this function.
.LP
When either text, or annotation text, is displayed during structure traversal,
the current text index in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 
traversal state list
refers to an entry in the extended text bundle table. If the
current text index is not present in the extended text
bundle table, then text index one is used. The setting of the 
corresponding Aspect Source Flags(\s-2ASF\s+2s) determines which 
aspects in the entry are used.

.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, WSOP, *, *\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(that is, the workstation category is neither \s-2OUTPUT\s+2,
\s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 100
Ignoring function, the bundle index value is less than one
.IP 103
Ignoring function, setting this bundle table entry would exceed the maximum
number of entries allowed in the workstation bundle table
.IP 106
Ignoring function, the specified font is not available for the 
requested text precision on the specified workstation
.IP 110
Ignoring function, the specified colour model is not available on the 
workstation
.IP 113
Ignoring function, the colour index value is less than zero
.IP 136
Ignoring function, one of the components of the color specification
is out of range
