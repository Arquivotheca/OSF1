.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2INQUIRE POLYMARKER FACILITIES\s+2 obtains a list of the polymarker facilities available on the specified type of workstation.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fItype\fP
Get the polymarker facilities for this workstation type.
.IP \fIlength\fP
The number of \fIints\fR in the \fIfacilities\fR\(->\fItypes\fR output parameter for
which the application has allocated memory.
\fIlength\fR is the number of list elements that the system can return in
\fIfacilities\fR\(->\fItypes.ints\fR.
If a value of 0 is used here, no data will be returned in the
\fIfacilities\fR\(->\fItypes.ints\fR list, but the total number of
elements will be returned in \fItotal_length\fR.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position of inquiry.  The elements in the list, beginning
with the item number specified by \fIstart\fR, are copied sequentially into 
\fIfacilities\fR\(->\fItypes.ints\fR until \fIfacilities\fR\(->\fItypes.ints\fR is full
or all the elements have been copied.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIfacilities\fP
A pointer to a structure in which the system returns the portion of the
list of polymarker facilities from the
workstation description table, starting with start.
Pmarker_facs is defined in phigs.h as:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint_list     'u +\w'num_pred_inds;     'u
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint_list	types;	/* list of marker types */
	Pint	num_sizes;	/* number of available marker sizes */
	Pfloat	nom_size;	/* nominal marker size */
	Pfloat	min_size;	/* minimum marker size */
	Pfloat	max_size;	/* maximum marker size */
	Pint	num_pred_inds;	/* number of predefined bundles */ 
.sp .2
} Pmarker_facs;
.IP
.fi
And Pint_list is defined as:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'num_ints;     'u
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of integers */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of integers */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
.IP
Prior to calling this function, the \fIints\fR field of the Pint_list
structure must contain a pointer to an application supplied buffer.
This buffer must be at least as large as the \fIlength\fR parameter.
.IP \fItotal_length\fR
A pointer to an integer in which the system returns the total number of elements
in the list.  This is the value required for \fIlength\fR if all elements in the
list are to be returned.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, *\s+2)
.IP 051
Ignoring function, this information is not yet available
for this workstation type; open a workstation of this type
and use the specific workstation type
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have
output capability (that is, the workstation category is neither 
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 062
Ignoring function, this information is not available for this
\s-2MO\s+2 workstation type
