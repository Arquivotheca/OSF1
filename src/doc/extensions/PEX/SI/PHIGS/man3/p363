.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET POLYLINE SHADING METHOD\s+2
places a polyline structure element with the value polyline 
shading method into the open structure. When the current polyline
shading method Aspect Source Flag (\s-2ASF\s+2) is set to
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2,
the current value of this attribute
applies to the following output primitives:

.SS Execution
Depending on the edit mode, a
\s-2SET POLYLINE SHADING METHOD\s+2
element is inserted into the open structure after the element
pointer, or replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer.
In either case, the element pointer is updated to point to the newly 
created
\s-2SET POLYLINE SHADING METHOD\s+2
element.
.LP
When the structure is traversed, the current polyline shading method 
entry in the traversal state list is set to the specified value.
This value is used with subsequent line
output primitives when the current polyline shading method \s-2ASF\s+2 entry
in the traversal state list is 
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2.
During traversal, if the specified shading method is not available
on a workstation, method 1 will be used on that workstation.
.LP
When the current polyline shading method \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to \s-2BUNDLED\s+2,
the polyline shading method is taken from the
workstation extended representation indicated by the current polyline index.
In this case, the polyline shading method
set with \s-2SET POLYLINE SHADING METHOD\s+2 has no effect.
.LP
When the shading method is \s-2NONE\s+2, each segment of the polyline or curve
is drawn in a single colour.  If the primitive specifies per-vertex
colour, each segment is drawn using the colour associated with
the first vertex of the segment.
