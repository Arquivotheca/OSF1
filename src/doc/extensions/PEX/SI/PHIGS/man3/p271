.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2SAMPLE CHOICE\s+2 to sample the current measure of the specified
choice device without waiting for the device trigger to fire. The device
must be in \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 mode.
See \s-2SET CHOICE MODE\s+2 and \s-2INITIALIZE CHOICE\s+2 for more information.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
Workstation identifier. An integer specifying the workstation with which
the specified choice device is associated.
.IP \fIdev\fP
The device number of the choice device to be sampled.
See the \fIAvailable Devices\fP section of \s-2INITIALIZE CHOICE\s+2
for a description of the available devices.
.SS C Output Parameter
.IP \fIchoice_in_status\fP
A pointer to a location to store the status of the sample.
Pin_status is defined in phigs.h as:
.sp .4
.ta .5i
.nf
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PIN_STATUS_NONE,
	PIN_STATUS_OK,
	PIN_STATUS_NO_IN
.sp .2
} Pin_status;
.fi
.IP \fIchoice\fP
A pointer to a location to store the results of the choice.
.SS Execution
\s-2SAMPLE CHOICE\s+2 samples the specified choice device. The
device must be in \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 mode.
See \s-2SET CHOICE MODE\s+2 and \s-2INITIALIZE CHOICE\s+2 for more
information.
.LP
When a device is set to \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 mode, a measure process is created
for the device and the device is activated. When \s-2SAMPLE CHOICE\s+2 is
called, the current value of the measure process for the specified device
is retrieved without waiting for the device's trigger to fire.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, WSOP, *, *\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 061
Ignoring function, specified workstation is neither of category \s-2INPUT\s+2
nor of category \s-2OUTIN\s+2
.IP 250
Ignoring function, the specified device is not available
on the specified workstation
.IP 252
Ignoring function, the function requires the input device to
be in \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 mode
