.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE LIST OF PATTERN INDICES\s+2 to obtain a list of the
currently defined pattern indices on the specified workstation.  
The defined pattern table indices are \fIconceptually sparse\fP:  a \s-2PHIGS\s+2
implementation could allow definition of \fIn\fP pattern representations
with arbitrary indices.  
However, pattern indices are
\fInonsparse\fP in \s-2PEX-SI\s0;  the \fIn\fP pattern representations
necessarily have indices 1 through \fIn\fP.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The \fIworkstation identifier\fP of the workstation
whose pattern indices are to be returned.
.IP \fIlength\fP
Number of items for which the application has allocated memory
in the output parameter \fIindices\fP.
0 can be specified, in order to get the \fItotal length\fP of the list.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position in the list at which to begin the inquiry.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIindices\fP
A pointer to a Pint_list structure
in which the system returns the portion of the
list of currently defined pattern indices,
starting at the entry specified with \fIstart\fP.
.IP
Pint_list is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'num_ints;     'u
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of integers */
.fi
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.sp .5
The pointer \fIindices\fR\(->\fIints\fR must be initialized to an array of
\fIlength\fP \fIPint\fP elements.
.IP \fItotal_length\fP
A pointer to an integer in which to return the \fItotal length\fP of
the list.
This is the value required for \fIlength\fP if all the items in the
list are to be returned.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2WSOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(in other words, the workstation category is neither \s-2OUTPUT\s+2,
\s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
