.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET PATTERN SIZE\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the current pattern width vector
and current pattern height vector attributes.
When the interior style is
\s-2PATTERN\s+2,
these attributes apply to the following output primitives:
.ta .5i +1.75i

	\(bu  \s-2FILL AREA\s+2	\(bu  \s-2NON-UNIFORM B-SPLINE SURFACE\s+2
	\(bu  \s-2FILL AREA 3\s+2	\(bu  \s-2SET OF FILL AREA SET 3 WITH DATA\s+2
	\(bu  \s-2FILL AREA SET\s+2	\(bu  \s-2TRIANGLE STRIP 3 WITH DATA\s+2
	\(bu  \s-2FILL AREA SET 3\s+2	\(bu  \s-2QUADRILATERAL MESH 3 WITH DATA \s+2
	\(bu  \s-2FILL AREA SET 3 WITH DATA\s+2

.LP
\fBNote:\fP This function places the appropriate data in the
Central Structure Store and in \s-2PEX-SI\s0 archives,
but the structure element is currently ignored during traversal.
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2 when \s-2SET PATTERN SIZE\s+2 is
called, the \s-2SET PATTERN SIZE\s+2 element is inserted into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer. If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the new element
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer. In either case, the
element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIsize_x\fP
The \fIx\fR coordinate of the pattern size,
specified in Modelling Coordinates (MC).
.IP \fIsize_y\fP
The \fIy\fR coordinate of the pattern size,
specified in Modelling Coordinates (MC).
.SS Execution
When the \s-2SET PATTERN SIZE\s+2 element is traversed, the
current pattern size entry in the traversal state list
is set to the element's \fIpattern size\fR.
.LP
When the interior style
(either individual or bundled, as selected by the current interior style ASF)
is set to \s-2PATTERN\s+2, the attribute is used in conjunction with
the current pattern reference point and vectors for the area-defining primitives
that follow in the structure network.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state
