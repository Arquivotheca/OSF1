.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
The \s-2TEXT\s+2 subroutine puts a structure element containing the full
specification of a two-dimensional \s-2TEXT\s+2 primitive into the
currently open structure.
.LP
The \s-2TEXT\s+2 primitive is a character string. The location of the
string in the display is controlled by the \fItext point\fP subroutine parameter, 
specified in Modelling Coordinates.
The \fIz\fP coordinate is assumed to be 0.
Aspects of the text display, such as the font, colour, spacing, height,
and alignment, are controlled by the current values of the primitive
attributes listed below.
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, the structure element created
by the \s-2TEXT\s+2 subroutine is inserted into the open structure
after the element pointed to by the current \fIelement pointer\fR.
If the current edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the new \s-2TEXT\s+2
element replaces the element in the structure pointed to by the \fIelement pointer\fR.
In either case, the \fIelement pointer\fR
is updated to point to the new \s-2TEXT\s+2 element.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fItext_pt\fP
A pointer to a Ppoint structure containing the \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP coordinates
that locate the text string.
The Ppoint structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pfloat     'u +\w'x;     'u
.nf
typedef struct  {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	x;	/* x coordinate */
	Pfloat	y;	/* y coordinate */
.sp .2
} Ppoint;
.fi
.IP \fItext\fP
A pointer to the character string to be written into the display.
.SS Execution
When the structure is traversed, the \s-2TEXT\s+2 element draws the
specified character string.
The position of the text is defined in relation to \fItext point\fP by the
current values of the text primitive attributes \s-2 CHARACTER UP VECTOR, TEXT PATH,\s+2 and \s-2TEXT ALIGNMENT\s+2.
.LP
Other aspects of the appearance of the text are controlled by the
attributes \s-2TEXT FONT, TEXT PRECISION, CHARACTER HEIGHT, CHARACTER
WIDTH, CHARACTER EXPANSION FACTOR, CHARACTER SPACING,\s+2 and \s-2TEXT COLOUR INDEX\s+2.
.LP
The text point is specified in Modelling Coordinates.
The text primitive is subject to the current transformations in the transformation pipeline from the Modelling Coordinate System to the workstation display.
.SS Attributes Applied
The attributes listed below are used to display the
\s-2TEXT\s+2 primitive when the structure is traversed. The Aspect Source 
Flags (\s-2ASF\s+2s) tell where to access the output display attributes. 
These attributes can come directly from the traversal state list,
or they can be accessed indirectly, using the appropriate index 
in the traversal state list and the corresponding bundled 
representation in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 workstation state list.
