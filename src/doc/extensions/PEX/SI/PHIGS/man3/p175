.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE PATTERN REPRESENTATION\s+2 to determine the pattern
representation on a specified workstation for a given pattern index.
.LP
.SS C Input Parameters
Applications using the \s-2C\s+2 binding must create a buffer to be used by this
function as memory space for storing data associated with the device state.
This buffer is passed as the \fIstore\fP argument.  
.LP
The store buffer is a data area managed by \s-2PHIGS\s+2. While the application 
is responsible for creating the inital buffer through a call to \s-2\CREATE STORE\s+2, 
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 manages this area such that there is sufficient memory for the 
specific inquiry. The data record within the store buffer is accessed 
by the pointer pointed to by \fIrep\fR.
.IP \fIws \fP
Workstation identifier.
.IP \fIindex \fP
Entry to be returned from the workstation's table of pattern representations;
if this entry is not present in the table and the
type of returned value parameter is \s-2REALIZED\s+2,
the representation for pattern index 1 is returned.
.IP \fItype \fP
An enumerated value specifying whether the inquired values are to be returned
as the values originally specified by the application (\s-2SET\s+2),
or as the values actually being used by the workstation
if any of the application-specified values
had to be mapped to ones available on the workstation (\s-2REALIZED\s+2).
Valid values are defined in phigs.h as:
.sp
.ta .5i +\w'PINQ_REALIZED     'u
.nf
	PINQ_SET	\fIreturn application-specified value\fP
	PINQ_REALIZED	\fIreturn value available on the workstation\fP
.fi
.IP \fIstore\fP
The memory buffer \s-2PHIGS\s+2 is to use for storing the information
returned.  
This buffer must exist prior to calling this function (see
\s-2CREATE STORE (3P)\s+2).
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIrep\fP
A pointer to a pointer to a Ppat_rep structure in which the system returns
the pattern representation at index in the workstation table of 
pattern representations. Ppat_rep is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint_size     'u +\w'*colr_array;     'u
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint_size	dims;	/* pattern's dimensions */
	Pint	*colr_array;	/* colour index array *
.sp .2
} Ppat_rep;
.fi
.sp .2
The Pint_size structure used to define the pattern dimensions is defined in
phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'size_x;     'u
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	size_x;	/* dimension (number of divisions) along X */
	Pint	size_y;	/* dimension (number of divisions) along Y */
.sp .2
} Pint_size;
.fi
The \fIcolr_array\fR component is a pointer to an array of the colour indices
defining the pattern, of the dimensions defined by the \fIdims\fR component.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, WSOP, *, *\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(that is, the workstation category is neither \s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 112
Ignoring function, the pattern index value is less than one
.IP 101
Ignoring function, the specified representation has not been defined
.IP 109
Ignoring function, interior style \s-2PATTERN\s+2 is not
supported on the workstation
