.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2OPEN WORKSTATION\s+2 opens a workstation of the specified workstation type.
The workstation state list is created and initialized to conform as nearly as
possible to the workstation description table associated with the specified
workstation type.
If the workstation is successfully opened, the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 workstation
state variable is set to \s-2WSOP\s+2.
.LP
\s-2PEX-SI\s0 supports two predefined workstation types, \fIx_tool\fR and
\fIx_drawable\fR.  Their characteristics are described below.
In addition, the application can create and modify its own workstation types
with the \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE CREATE\s+2 and \S-2WORKSTATION TYPE SET\s+2
functions.
.LP
If the workstation is opened successfully, a specific workstation type is
created and associated with the open workstation.
This specific workstation type contains the workstation description table
that describes the capabilities of the opened workstation.
The specific workstation type can be retrieved with
\s-2INQUIRE WORKSTATION CONNECTION AND TYPE\s+2.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws_id\fP
The workstation identifier to be associated with this workstation.
This value is used to identify the workstation in subsequent \s-2PHIGS\s+2
function calls.
.IP \fIconn_id\fP
A pointer to the connection identifier of the workstation.  The type of value to
use depends on the workstation type:
.RS
.IP "x_tool"
If the \fIconn_id\fP is \s-2NULL\s+2, a window is created on the default
server.
If the \fIconn_id\fP is not \s-2NULL\s+2, it is interpreted as a display
name and a window for the workstation is
created on the named server,
provided that server supports the X extension.
An example of using this would be:
.RS
.IP
Popen_ws (ws_id, (char*)"unix:0", phigs_ws_type_x_tool);
.RE
.IP "x_drawable"
The connection identifier must be a pointer to a Pconnid_x_drawable
structure, cast to a char*.
Pconnid_x_drawable is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp
.nf
.ta .5i +1.0i +1.25i
typdef struct {
	Display	*display;
	XID	drawable_id;
} Pconnid_x_drawable;
.RE
.fi
.IP \fIws_type\fP
The type of workstation to open.
Recognized types are described fully in the \fIAvailable Workstation Types\fP
section below.  They are declared in phigs.h.
A short summary is listed here:
.RS
.IP "\fIphigs_ws_type_x_tool\fP"
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 creates an X window for the workstation on a specified
or default server.
.IP "\fIphigs_ws_type_x_drawable\fP"
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 uses a specified X window for the workstation.
.RE
.SS Execution
\s-2OPEN WORKSTATION\s+2 opens a \s-2PHIGS\s+2 workstation of the specified
type and associates it with the specified workstation identifier.
.LP
When a workstation is opened, \s-2PHIGS\s+2 creates a copy of
the workstation type specified in the \s-2OPEN WORSTATION\s+2 call and
binds it to the opened workstation.
This copy is called the \fIspecific\fP workstation type.
The workstation description table \s-2(WDT)\s+2 of this specific type is
checked against the capabilities of the server and
window \s-2PHIGS\s+2 is using for the workstation.
If the capabilities specified by the \s-2WDT\s+2 cannot be realized with
that server and window, \s-2PHIGS\s+2 modifies the \s-2WDT\s+2
of the specific workstation type to reflect the available capabilities.
The workstation type parameter to \s-2OPEN WORKSTATION\s+2 is not
modified; only the specific workstation type is (potentially) modified.
The specific workstation type bound to a workstation can be retrieved with
the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 function \s-2INQUIRE WORKSTATION CONNECTION AND TYPE\s+2.
.LP
Some of a workstation type's workstation description table values can be
changed by the application prior to opening a workstation of that type.
See \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE CREATE\s+2 and \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE SET\s+2 for
more information on this.
.SS Available Workstation Types
.SS "\fIphigs_ws_type_x_tool\fP"
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 creates an X window on a specified or default server and
uses it for the PHIGS workstation's display surface.
If the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 Monitor is running (see \s-2OPEN PHIGS\s+2),
the default category of this workstation type is \s-2OUTIN\s+2,
which indicates that both input and output are available;
otherwise the default category is \s-2OUTPUT\s+2.
.LP
If the category is \s-2OUTIN\s+2, \s-2PHIGS\s+2 creates an additional
input-only window that it uses to detect pointer events for its Locator,
Stroke, and Pick input devices.
This window is transparent, overlies the output window completely, and
duplicates any size and position changes made to the ouput window.
.LP
Many of the characteristics of an x_tool workstation type,
such as its size and position, can be set prior to opening the workstation.
See \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE CREATE\s+2 and \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE SET\s+2 for a
complete list of the modifiable characteristics and their default settings.
.SS "\fIphigs_ws_type_x_drawable\fP"
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 uses an application-specified X window for the PHIGS
workstation's display surface.
The window to use is specified in the connection identifier parameter.
The window must be open and associated with a server that supports the
\s-2PEX\s+2 extension.
.LP
If the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 Monitor is running (see \s-2OPEN PHIGS\s+2),
the default category of this workstation type is \s-2OUTIN\s+2,
which indicates that both input and output are available;
otherwise the default category is \s-2OUTPUT\s+2.
.LP
Some of the characteristics of an x_drawable workstation type,
such as its size and position, can be set prior to opening the workstation.
See \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE CREATE\s+2 and \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE SET\s+2 for a
complete list of the modifiable characteristics and their default settings.
.SS "Window System Interaction"
Workstation \s-2DC\s+2 limits correspond to the window size used by
the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 workstation when the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 workstation is opened.
The units are drawable coordinates.  When the \s-2API\s+2 responds to
a window resize event, more or less of the window will be exposed;
the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 output will not be scaled.
Decreases in size cause portions of the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 output to be
clipped away if the new size is less than the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 viewport limits.
Size increase beyond the viewport limits will not reveal any additional
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 ouput.
.LP
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 automatically redraws the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 workstation when portions of
it are exposed, such as when it is brought to the top of other windows or
moved from an iconic state to an open state.
This redrawing may potentially change portions of the workstation state
list by making the ``state of visual representation'' correct and making
all requested entries current.
.LP
For both tool and drawable workstations, a DestroyNotify event on the
workstation's window will cause \s-2PHIGS\s+2 to exit.
A DestroyNotify event is generated either by the application or more
likely by the operator when he destroys or ``Quit''s the window.
