.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
The \s-2POLYLINE 3\s+2 function places a structure element containing
the full specification of a \s-2\&3D\s+2 polyline into the currently open structure,
according to the current edit mode.
A \s-2\&3D\s+2 polyline primitive is a set of connected straight lines in \s-2\&3D\s+2 space
defined by a series of Modelling Coordinate (\s-2MC\s+2) points. A polyline may
be closed or self-intersecting.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIpoint_list\fP
A pointer to a Ppoint_list3 structure containing a list of Ppoint3 structures,
which contain the \fIx\fP, \fIy\fP, and \fIz\fR coordinates for each point.
At least two points must be specified; a polyline structure element that has
fewer than two points will be treated in a workstation dependent fashion.
.IP
The Ppoint_list3 structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Ppoint3	'u +\w'num_points;     'u
.nf
typedef struct  {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_points;	/* number of Ppoint3s in the list */
	Ppoint3	*points;	/* list of points */
.sp .2
} Ppoint_list3;
.sp .4
.fi
The \fInum_points\fR component specifies the number of elements in the list.
The \fIpoints\fR component is a pointer to a list of Ppoint3s \fInum_points\fR long.
The Ppoint3 structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pfloat     'u +\w'x;     'u
.nf
typedef struct  {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	x;	/* x coordinate */
	Pfloat	y;	/* y coordinate */
	Pfloat	z;	/* z coordinate */
.sp .2
} Ppoint3;
.fi
.SS Execution
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, the \s-2POLYLINE 3\s+2 element
is inserted into the open structure after the element pointed to by the
element pointer. If the current edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the
\s-2POLYLINE 3\s+2 element replaces the element pointed to by the element
pointer.  In either case, the element pointer is updated to point to the
new \s-2POLYLINE 3\s+2 element.
.LP
When the structure is traversed, the polyline element draws straight
lines between the points specified, beginning with the first point
and ending with the last. The current values of the attributes listed
below will be applied to the polyline when it is drawn.
.LP
The coordinates used to specify the polyline primitive are called
Model Coordinates (\s-2MC\s+2).
Model Coordinates can be any coordinate units that are convenient to the application.
At traversal, these coordinate values are transformed by the current local
and global modelling transformations, the view representation selected by
the \fIcurrent view index\fP, and the workstation transformation current
on the workstation to which the structure is posted.
.SS Attributes Applied
The attributes listed below are used to display the
\s-2POLYLINE 3\s+2 primitive when the structure is traversed. The Aspect Source 
Flags (\s-2ASF\s+2s) tell where to access the output display attributes. 
These attributes can come directly from the traversal state list,
or they can be accessed indirectly, using the appropriate index 
in the traversal state list and the corresponding bundled 
representation in the PHIGS workstation state list.
