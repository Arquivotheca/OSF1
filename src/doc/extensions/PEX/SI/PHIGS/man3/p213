.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE STRUCTURE STATE VALUE\s+2 to determine the current
structure state.  The state value may be ``structure open'' (\s-2STOP\s+2),
or ``structure closed'' (\s-2STCL\s+2).
.LP
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIstruct_state \fP
A pointer to a Pstruct_st enumerated variable in which the current structure 
state value is returned.
Values for Pstruct_st are defined in phigs.h as follows:
