.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2GET VALUATOR\s+2 retrieves the current event report from the \s-2PHIGS\s+2
state list when the event report contains a \s-2VALUATOR\s+2 event.
.LP
A \s-2VALUATOR\s+2 event consists of a floating point number that the
operator has selected.
.SS C Output Parameter
.IP \fIvaluator\fP
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 copies the event's contents to the variable pointed to by
\fIvaluator\fP.
.SS Execution
\s-2GET VALUATOR\s+2 retrieves the contents of a \s-2VALUATOR\s+2
event from the current event report in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 state list.
.LP
When an input device that is set to \s-2EVENT\s+2 mode is triggered
by the operator,
an event report is added to the input event queue.
The event report contains the identity and current measure of the triggered
device.
\s-2AWAIT EVENT\s+2 moves the measure of the oldest event in the input queue
to the current event report in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 state list.
If the event was a \s-2VALUATOR\s+2 event, \s-2GET VALUATOR\s+2 is used to
retrieve the contents of the event from the current event report.
.LP
See \s-2INITIALIZE VALUATOR 3\s+2 for a description of the available
\s-2VALUATOR\s+2 devices and how their measure values are determined.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, WSOP, *, *\s+2)
.IP 259
Ignoring function, the input device class of the current input report
does not match the class being requested
