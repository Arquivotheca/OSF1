.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET DEPTH CUE REPRESENTATION\s+2
assigns parameter values defining a depth cue operation to a 
specified index number in the workstation table of defined depth
cue representations.  Each entry in this table contains a value
for depth cue mode, reference planes, scaling, and colour.  When 
enabled, depth cueing is applied to all output primitives 
subsequently displayed.  
.LP
Depth cueing mixes a scaled portion of the depth cue colour with 
the primitive colour as a function of the \fIz\fP coordinate in 
\s-2NPC\s+2 space.  Using the background colour as the depth cue colour,
this operation allows you to fade the colour of the parts 
of the primitives that are further from the viewer in the display.  
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The workstation identifier specifies the workstation for which
the depth cue representation is to be defined.  The workstation 
must have been opened with the \s-2OPEN WORKSTATION\s+2
subroutine before calling
\s-2SET DEPTH CUE REPRESENTATION\s+2.  
.IP \fIindex\fP
The index to the workstation depth cue bundle table.  
.IP
The index number corresponds to an entry in the table of defined depth cue
operations in the workstation state list.  Up to 20 depth cue table
entries can be defined.  Entry zero is predefined to a depth cue mode of 
\s-2PSUPPRESSED\s+2 and cannot be changed.  Entries other than zero can be 
changed with the 
\s-2SET DEPTH CUE REPRESENTATION\s+2
subroutine.  
.IP \fIrep\fP
A pointer to a Pdcue_bundle data structure containing attribute
values defining a depth cue representation.  A Pdcue_bundle structure
is defined in phigs.h as follows:  
.nf
.ta .5i +1.25i  +1i   +1.25i
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pdcue_mode	mode;	/* depth cue mode */
	Pfloat	ref_planes[2];	/* depth cue reference planes */
	Pfloat	scaling[2];	/* depth cue scaling */
	Pgcolr	colr;	/* depth cue colour */
.sp .2
} Pdcue_bundle;
.fi
.IP
Pdcue_mode is defined as:
.ta .5i
.nf
.sp .4
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PSUPPRESSED,
	PALLOWED
.sp .2
} Pdcue_mode;
.fi
.IP
Refplanes and scaling entries of 0 are back reference plane and
corresponding scaling factors.  Refplanes and scaling entries of 1 
are front reference plane and corresponding scaling factors.  These
scaling factors define the portion of the primitive colour that should
be combined with the depth cue colour, as a function of \fIz\fP
in \s-2NPC\s+2.  
.IP
Pgcolr is defined as:
.ta .5i +1.5i   +1i  +2i
.nf
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	type;	/* indirect, RGB, CIE, HSV, HLS */
	union {
	     Pint	ind;	/* index in workstation colour bundle table */
	     struct {
	          Pfloat	x;	/* red, hue, etc. */
	          Pfloat	y;	/* green, saturation, lightness, etc. */
	          Pfloat	z;	/* blue, value, saturation, etc. */
	     } general;
	} val;
} Pgcolr;
.fi
.IP
Constants defined for colour type are:  
.sp .2

4       PMODEL_HLS		\fIHue, Lightness, Saturation\fP
.fi
.SS Execution
When a 
\s-2SET DEPTH CUE REPRESENTATION\s+2
is called, the entry
index in the table of defined depth cue representations
on the workstation identifier is set to the values in \fIrep\fP.  
.LP
During structure traversal, the current depth cue representation
is selected from the workstation table by a structure element
created by the \s-2SET DEPTH CUE INDEX\s+2
subroutine.  While the
depth cue mode of the current representation is \s-2ALLOWED\s+2,
the depth cue operation defined by the other representation 
parameters is applied to all the following primitives in the 
structure network.  
.LP
The depth cueing operation changes the primitive colours in the
display as a function of their \fIz\fP coordinate in \s-2NPC\s+2 space.  
The first number in scaling specifies the portion of the
primitive colour that is combined with the depth cue colour at,
or in front of, the front reference plane.  The second scaling
value specifies the portion of primitive colour applied at, or
behind, the back reference plane.  The portion of depth cue colour
applied to primitives between the two planes is scaled by a value
linearly interpolated between the two scaling values.  
.\".RE
.LP
When a workstation is opened, entries zero and one are initialized 
with the following representation:  
.sp .5
.nf
.ta .5i +.5i +.5i +1i +1.5i
				\fIEntry 0		Entry 1\fP
.sp .2
	depth cue mode		SUPPRESSED	ALLOWED
	depth cue reference planes	0.0, 1.0	0.0, 1.0
	depth cue scaling		1.0, 1.0	0.0, 1.0
	depth cue colour		(INDIRECT, 0)	(INDIRECT, 0)
.fi
.sp .5
.LP
For depth cue reference planes and depth cue scaling, the first
value is the back reference plane and scaling.
