.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET POLYLINE INDEX\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a polyline index number, which selects an entry
from the workstation's polyline bundle table.
This attribute applies to the output primitives:

.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIindex\fP
A \fIpolyline index\fP for a polyline representation on the workstation.
.SS Execution
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2,
a \s-2SET POLYLINE INDEX\s+2 element is inserted into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer. If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2,
the new \s-2SET POLYLINE INDEX\s+2 element
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer.
In either case, the element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.LP
When the \s-2SET POLYLINE INDEX\s+2 element is traversed,
the current polyline index value is set to the \fIpolyline index\fP,
which specifies an entry from the workstation's polyline bundle table.
The default \fIpolyline index\fP is 1, and
if the \fIpolyline index\fP specified is not available on the workstation,
1 will be used.
.LP
A polyline representation contains values for the following attributes:
.sp
.nf
.RS
\(bu  linetype
\(bu  linewidth scale factor
\(bu  polyline colour
.\"PHIGS+	and polyline shading method attributes
.fi
.sp
.RE
Line output primitives which follow in the structure network
will be drawn using the values from the specified representation
for those attributes whose Aspect Source Flag (\s-2ASF\s+2) is set to
\s-2BUNDLED\s+2.
When the \s-2ASF\s+2s are
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2,
the attributes come from the appropriate
\s-2SET\s+2
.I attribute
elements.
.LP
Polyline representations are defined with \s-2SET POLYLINE REPRESENTATION\s+2.
.\"PHIGS+	and \s-2SET POLYLINE REPRESENTATION PLUS\s+2.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, STOP, *\s+2)
.IP 100
Ignoring function, the bundle index value is less than one
