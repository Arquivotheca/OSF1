.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\*f attempts to map a single X drawable coordinate point to a \s-2PHIGS\s+2 pick path
using the specified workstation.
.LP
\*f provides similar functionality to a \s-2PHIGS\s+2 pick device, but it uses a
point provided by the application rather than directly by the operator.
This escape is not associated with any \s-2PHIGS\s+2 input device and can be used
without initializing any \s-2PHIGS\s+2 input device.
It is intended to allow the application to implement its own pick device 
using the standard X Event mechanism.
.SS C Input Parameters
Applications using the \s-2C\s+2 binding must create a buffer to be used by this
function as memory space for storing data associated with the device state.
This buffer is passed as the \fIstore\fP argument.  
.LP
The store buffer is a data area managed by \s-2PHIGS\s+2. While the application 
is responsible for creating the inital buffer through a call to \s-2\CREATE STORE\s+2, 
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 manages this area such that there is sufficient memory for the 
specific inquiry. The data record within the store buffer
is accessed by the pointer pointed to by \fIout\fR.
.IP \fIfunc_id\fP
The function identifier for this escape is \s-2PUESC_DRAWABLE_POINT_TO_PICK\s+2,
which is defined in phigs.h to be -4.
.IP \fIin\fP
A pointer to a Pescape_in_data union, which contains the \fIescape_in_u4\fR member
used by this escape function.
This member is defined in phigs.h as:
.nf
.ta .5i +.75i +1i
.sp .4
struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	ws_id;
	Ppoint	point;	/* a drawable point -- not DC */
	Pfloat	ap_size;	/* aperture size, half-width in DC units */
	Ppath_order	order;
	Pint	depth;	/* depth of path to return */
	Pint	pet;
	Pecho_switch	echo_switch;
	Plimit3		echo_volume;
	Pfilter		filter;	/* detectibility filter */
.sp .2
} escape_in_u4;	/* drawable point to pick */
.fi
.RS
.IP \fIws_id\fP
Indicates the workstation to use.  The structures posted to this
workstation and the current workstation state will be used to attempt the
mapping.
.IP \fIpoint\fP
A point, in X drawable units, that indicates the location of the pick
aperture.
.IP \fIap_size\fP
The size of the pick aperture, specified as the half-width of the aperture
box in DC units.
.IP \fIorder\fP
The order of the returned pick path.
The order can be either \s-2PORDER_TOP_FIRST\s+2, in which case the pick path will
be returned in traversal order, or \s-2PORDER_BOTTOM_FIRST\s+2, in which case the
pick path will be returned in the reverse of traversal order.
The order and depth parameters specify which portion of the complete pick
path, if any, is returned.
.IP \fIdepth\fP
The portion of the pick path to return.
If the order parameter is \s-2PORDER_TOP_FIRST\s+2 then the first "depth" elements
will be returned, if the order parameter is \s-2PORDER_BOTTOM_FIRST\s+2 then the
first "depth" elements in the inversely ordered pick path will be
returned.
.IP \fIpet\fP
Indicates the echo method to use for picked primitives.
.IP \fIecho_switch\fP
Indicates whether or not picked primitives should be echoed.
.IP \fIecho_volume\fP
The echo volume.
.IP \fIfilter\fP
The detectibility filter to use for the pick.
.RE
.IP \fIstore\fP
This parameter is not used for this escape.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIout\fP
A pointer to a pointer to a Pescape_out_data union, which contains the \fIescape_out_u4\fR
member used by this escape function.
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 copies a pointer to the pick status and pick path, if any, to this
member of the Pescape_out_data union.
This member is defined in phigs.h as:
.nf
.ta .5i +1.2i  +1.5i
.sp .4
struct {
.sp .2
	Pin_status	status;
	Ppick_path	pick;
.sp .2
} escape_out_u4;
.fi
.IP
\fIstatus\fP
contains the status of the pick.
\s-2PIN_STATUS_OK\s+2 indicates that the pick was successful and a pick path is
returned in the \fIpick\fR field.
\s-2PIN_STATUS_NONE\s+2 indicates that no primitive met the pick criteria.
The contents of the \fIpick\fR field are undefined in this case.
.IP
\fIpick\fP
contains the pick path if the status is \s-2PIN_STATUS_OK\s+2.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
