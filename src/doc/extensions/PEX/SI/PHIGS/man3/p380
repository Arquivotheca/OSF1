.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET TEXT PATH\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the text path attribute,
which controls the direction in which the string is written 
relative to the \fIcharacter up\fR and \fIcharacter base\fR vectors.  
This attribute applies to the following output primitives:  
.RS
.LP
\(bu 
.SM TEXT
.LP
\(bu
.SM "TEXT 3"
.RE
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, 
a \s-2SET TEXT PATH\s+2 element is inserted into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer.  
If the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the new \s-2SET TEXT PATH\s+2 
element replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer.  
In either case, the
element pointer is updated to point to the new element.  
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIpath\fP
The text path is one of the following enumerated values:
.sp .2
.ta .5i +\w'PPATH_DOWN 'u
.nf
	PPATH_RIGHT	   \fIRight\fP
	PPATH_LEFT	   \fILeft\fP
	PPATH_UP	   \fIUp\fP
	PPATH_DOWN	   \fIDown\fP
.sp .2
.fi
.SS Execution
When the \s-2SET TEXT PATH\s+2 element is traversed, the current text path
entry in the traversal state list is set to text path.  
The text path determines the direction of displacement between
one character and the next in a string, defined in relation to the
\fIcharacter up\fR and \fIcharacter base\fR vectors.  
.LP
If text path is set to \fIRight\fP, then the text string is written
along a base line in the direction of the \s-2CHARACTER BASE VECTOR\s+2.  
If text path is set to \fILeft\fP, then the text string is written
along a base line in the direction opposite to the \s-2CHARACTER BASE
VECTOR\s+2.  
If text path is set to \fIUp\fP, then the text string is written in
the direction of the \s-2CHARACTER UP VECTOR\s+2.  
If text path is set to \fIDown\fP, the text string is written in
the direction opposite to the \s-2CHARACTER UP VECTOR\s+2.  
.LP
\fBNote:\fP  Text path controls only the direction in which the string
is written.  The position of the string in relation to the text position
point is controlled by the text alignment.
