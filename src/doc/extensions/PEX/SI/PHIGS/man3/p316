.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
.IX "Element Pointer" "SET ELEMENT POINTER AT LABEL"
.IX "Current Element Pointer" "SET ELEMENT POINTER AT LABEL"
\s-2SET ELEMENT POINTER AT LABEL\s+2 sets the element pointer of the currently open structure to the next occurrence in the structure of an element containing the specified label identifier. Label structure elements are created by the \s-2LABEL\s+2 subroutine.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIlabel_id\fP
Specifies the label identifier in the open structure at which to set the element pointer.
.SS Execution
\s-2SET ELEMENT POINTER AT LABEL\s+2 searches for the label identifier from the structure element following the current element pointer to the end of the open structure. If an occurrence of \fIlabel identifier\fP is not found between the current element pointer and the end of the structure, the subroutine does not move the element pointer and generates an error.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2STOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 205
Ignoring function, the label does not exist in the open structure
between the element pointer and the end of the structure
