.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2INQUIRE HLHSR MODE FACILITIES\s+2 obtains the available \s-2HLHSR\s+2
(hidden line and hidden surface removal) modes
on the specified workstation type.  See \s-2SET HLHSR MODE\s+2 for a 
description of how to select the mode.
.SS C Input Parameters
.sp .3
.IP \fItype \fP
Type of workstation.
.IP \fIlength\fP
The number of \fIints\fR in the \fImodes\fR output parameter for which the 
application has allocated memory. \fIlength\fR is the number of list elements
that the system can return in \fImodes\(->ints\fR.
If a value of 0 is used here, no data will be returned in the \fImodes\(->ints\fR
list, but the total number of modes in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 state list
will be returned in \fIlength_list\fR.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position of inquiry into the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 state list of 
current mode. The elements of the list of mode, beginning
with the item number specified by \fIstart\fR, are copied sequentially into 
\fImode\(->ints\fR until \fImodes\(->ints\fR is full or all the 
modes have been copied.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fImodes\fP
A pointer to a Pint_list data structure in which the system returns a 
list of the \s-2HLHSR\s+2 modes available on this workstation type. 
The returned list starts with the \fIstart\fP item in the list of 
modes and returns the next \fIlength\fP items. 
Pint_list is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.ta .5i +\w'Pint   'u +\w'num_ints;   'u
.nf
.sp .3
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of modes in list */
	Pint	*ints;	/* list of modes */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
Possible modes are:
.nf
.ta .5i +.25i +2.5i
.sp .2
	0	PHIGS_HLHSR_MODE_NONE 	\fIDisable \s-2HLHSR\s+2\fR
	1	PHIGS_HLHSR_MODE_ZBUFF	\fIEnable \s-2HLHSR\s+2 using Z-buffer\fR
	2	PHIGS_HLHSR_MODE_PAINTERS	\fIEnable \s-2HLHSR\s+2 using painter\fR
	3	PHIGS_HLHSR_MODE_SCANLINE	\fIEnable \s-2HLHSR\s+2 using scanline\fR
	4	PHIGS_HLHSR_MODE_LINE_ONLY	\fIEnable hidden line removal only\fR
.fi
.sp
.IP \fIlength_list\fP
A pointer to an integer in which the system returns the total number of elements
in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 state list of currently used modes. This is the value
required for \fIlength\fR if all modes are to be returned.
