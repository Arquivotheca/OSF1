.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE SET OF OPEN WORKSTATIONS\s+2 to obtain a list of the
identifiers fo the currently open workstations.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIlength\fP
The number of \fIints\fR in the \fIidlist\fR output parameter for which the 
application has allocated memory. \fIlength\fR is the number of list elements
that the system can return in \fIidlist\(->ints\fR.
If a value of 0 is used here, no data will be returned in the \fIidlist\(->ints\fR
list, but the total number of elements will be returned in \fItotal_length\fR.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position of inquiry.  The elements in the list, beginning
with the item number specified by \fIstart\fR, are copied sequentially into 
\fIidlist\(->ints\fR until \fIidlist\(->ints\fR is full
or all the elements have been copied.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIidlist\fP
A pointer to a Pint_list
in which the system returns the portion of the
list of currently open workstations
starting at the entry specified with \fIstart\fP.
Pint_list is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'num_ints;     'u
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint   num_ints;		/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint   *ints;		/* list of integers */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
.IP
The \fInum_ints\fP component specifies the number
of workstation identifiers in the list.
.IP
The pointer \fIints\fP must be initialized to an array,
\fIlength\fP long, of Pint elements.
.IP \fItotal_length\fP
A pointer to an integer in which to return the total length of the list.
This is the value required for \fIlength\fP if all the items in the
list are to be returned.
.SS Execution
.LP
If the inquired information is available, the error indicator is returned
as zero and values are returned in the output parameters.
.LP
If the inquired information is not available, the values returned in the
output parameters are undefined and the error indicator is
set to one of the below error numbers to indicate the reason for
nonavailability.
.LP
Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not invoked
when an error is detected by this function.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 2201
Start index out of range
