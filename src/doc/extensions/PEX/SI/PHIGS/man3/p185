.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE POLYMARKER REPRESENTATION\s+2 to determine the current attribute
values for a specified entry in a specified workstation's table of
defined polymarker representations.
.LP
See the description of the subroutine \s-2SET POLYMARKER REPRESENTATION\s+2 for information on the meaning of these attribute values.
.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
Workstation identifier.
.IP \fIindex\fP
Entry to be returned from the workstation's table of polymarker representations;
if this entry is not present in the table and the
\fItype of returned value\fP parameter is \s-2REALIZED\s+2,
the representation for polymarker index 1 is returned.
.IP \fItype\fP
An enumerated value specifying whether the inquired values are to be returned
as the values originally specified by the application (\s-2SET\s+2),
or as the values actually being used by the workstation
if any of the application-specified values
had to be mapped to ones available on the workstation (\s-2REALIZED\s+2).
Valid values are defined in phigs.h as:
.sp .2
.ta .5i +\w'PINQ_REALIZED     'u
.nf
	PINQ_SET	\fIReturn Application-specified Value\fP
	PINQ_REALIZED	\fIReturn Value Available on the Workstation\fP
.fi
.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIrep\fP
A pointer to a Pmarker_bundle structure in which the system returns the
polymarker representation at \fIindex\fP in the workstation's table of 
polymarker representations.
Pmarker_bundle is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pfloat     'u +\w'colr_ind;     'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	type;	/* marker type */
	Pfloat	size;	/* marker size scale factor */
	Pint	colr_ind;	/* colour index */
.sp .2
} Pmarker_bundle;
.fi
.IP
Values for \fItype\fR are:
.ta .5i +.5i 
.nf
	1	PMARKER_DOT
	2	PMARKER_PLUS
	3	PMARKER_ASTERISK
	4	PMARKER_CIRCLE	
	5	PMARKER_CROSS
.fi
.SS Execution
.LP
If the inquired information is available, the error indicator is
returned as zero and values are returned in the output parameters.
.LP
If the specified polymarker index is not present in the polymarker
bundle table on the workstation and the specified type of returned
value is \fIRealized\fP, the representation for polymarker index
one is returned.
.LP
If the inquired information is not available, the values returned
in the output parameters are undefined and the error
indicator is set to one of the following error numbers to indicate
the reason for nonavailability.
.LP
Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not invoked
when an error is detected by this function.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2WSOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(in other words, the workstation category is neither 
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 100
Ignoring function, the bundle index value is less than one
.IP 101
Ignoring function, the specified representation has not been defined
