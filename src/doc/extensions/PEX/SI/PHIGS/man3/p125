.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE DYNAMICS OF STRUCTURES\s+2 to determine the
dynamics of changes to structure contents and posting
for a specified workstation type.
.LP
The possible \fIdynamic modification accepted\fP values are:
.sp .3
.ta \w'PDYN_IRG     'u
\s-2PDYN_IRG\s+2		Modification leads to an \fIImplicit Regeneration\fP.
.sp .1
\s-2PDYN_IMM\s+2		Modification is performed \fIImmediately\fP, without an
implicit regeneration.
.sp .1
\s-2PDYN_CBS\s+2			Modification \fICan Be Simulated\fP before an
implicit regeneration is permitted.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fItype \fP
The workstation type whose capabilities are inquired.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIdynamics \fP
A pointer to a structure in which the system returns the
\fIdynamic modification accepted\fP values for various
structure manipulations.
Pdyns_structs is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.nf
.ta .5i +1.0i +1.25i
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pdyn_mod	content;	/* structure content */
	Pdyn_mod	post;	/* post structure */
	Pdyn_mod	unpost;	/* unpost structure */
	Pdyn_mod	del;	/* delete structure */
	Pdyn_mod	ref;	/* structure reference */
.sp .2
} Pdyns_structs;
.fi
.IP
The Pdyn_mod enumeration holds the dynamic modification accepted value,
one of the values \s-2PDYN_IRG\s+2, \s-2PDYN_IMM\s+2, or \s-2PDYN_CBS\s+2.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, *\s+2)
.IP 051
Ignoring function, this information is not yet available
for this workstation type; open a workstation of this type
and use the specific workstation type
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have
output capability (that is, the workstation category is neither 
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 062
Ignoring function, this information is not available for this
\s-2MO\s+2 workstation type
