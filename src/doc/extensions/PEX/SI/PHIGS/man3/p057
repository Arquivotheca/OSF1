.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
The \s-2FILL AREA 3\s+2 function puts a structure element containing the 
\s-2\&3D\s+2 specification of a \s-2FILL AREA 3\s+2 primitive into the currently open structure.
The \s-2FILL AREA 3\s+2 primitive is a closed polygonal area defined by a series of three dimensional Modelling Coordinate points.
.LP
\fBNote:\fP The \s-2FILL AREA 3\s+2 primitive \s-2INTERIOR\s+2 attributes
control the representation of the interior of the area
defined by the specified coordinate points. \s-2FILL AREA
3\s+2 does not have separate edge attributes. See the \s-2FILL AREA
SET\s+2 and \s-2FILL AREA SET 3\s+2 primitives for independent control of
the edge properties.
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, the structure element 
created by the \s-2FILL AREA 3\s+2 subroutine is inserted into the 
open structure after the element pointed to by the structure's 
element pointer. If the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the \s-2FILL 
AREA 3\s+2 element replaces the element pointed to by the element 
pointer. In either case, the element pointer is updated to point to 
the new \s-2FILL AREA 3\s+2 element.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIpoint_list\fP
A pointer to a list \fInum_points\fP long of Ppoint3 structures containing the
\fIx\fP, \fIy\fP, and \fIz\fP coordinates for each point used to define
the \s-2FILL AREA 3\s+2 polygon.
The Ppoint_list3 structure is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Ppoint     'u +\w'num_points;     'u
.nf
typedef struct  {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_points;	/* number of Ppoint3 structures in the list */
	Ppoint3	*points;	/* list of points */
.sp .2
} Ppoint_list3;
.fi
.IP
Ppoint3 is defined as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pfloat     'u +\w'x;     'u
.nf
typedef struct  {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	x;	/* x coordinate */
	Pfloat	y;	/* y coordinate */
	Pfloat	z;	/* z coordinate */
.sp .2
} Ppoint3;
.fi
.SS Execution
When the structure is traversed, the \s-2FILL AREA 3\s+2 element  
draws a closed polygonal area.  The appearance of the interior of the 
defined area is determined by the attributes listed below. These 
attributes control the type of fill (\s-2SOLID, EMPTY, HOLLOW, HATCH\s+2, 
and \s-2PATTERN\s+2) and the colour in which the primitive is drawn.
.LP
The coordinate points are specified in Modelling Coordinate points.
Modelling Coordinate units may be any that are convenient to the application.
At traversal, these coordinate values are transformed by the current
Local and Global Modelling Transformations, the View Representation
selected by the current view index, and the Workstation Transformation
current on the workstation to which the structure is posted.
.\"See Chapter 7, "Transformations" in the \fI\s-2PEX-SI\s0 Programming Guide\fP for
.\"more information.
.SS Attributes Applied
The attributes listed below are used to display the
\s-2FILL AREA 3\s+2 primitive when the structure is traversed. The Aspect Source
Flags (\s-2ASF\s+2s) tell where to access the output display attributes. 
These attributes can come directly from the traversal state list,
or they can be accessed indirectly, using the appropriate index 
in the traversal state list and the corresponding bundled 
representation in the PHIGS workstation state list.
