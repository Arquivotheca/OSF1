.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET MARKER SIZE SCALE FACTOR\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the current marker size scale factor attribute.
.LP
When the current marker size scale factor Aspect Source Flag \s-2(ASF)\s+2
is set to \s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2,
the current value of this attribute
defines the marker size scale factor to be applied to the output primitives:

.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIsize\fP
A real value specifying the marker size scale factor.
.SS Execution
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2,
a \s-2SET MARKER SIZE SCALE FACTOR\s+2 element is inserted
after the element pointed to by the current element pointer.
If the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2,
the new \s-2SET MARKER SIZE SCALE FACTOR\s+2 element
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer. In either case, the
element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.LP
When the \s-2SET MARKER SIZE SCALE FACTOR\s+2 element is traversed,
the current marker size scale factor entry
in the traversal state list set to marker size scale factor.
.LP
When the current marker size scale factor \s-2ASF\s+2 is
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2,
\s-2POLYMARKER\s+2 and \s-2POLYMARKER 3\s+2 output primitives that follow in
the structure network are drawn using the marker size scale factor
specified.
This scaling factor is multiplied by the nominal marker size defined
in the workstation description table, and the nearest available size
on the workstation is used.
.LP
When the current marker size scale factor \s-2ASF\s+2 is \s-2BUNDLED\s+2,
the effective marker size scale factor is
the marker size scale factor attribute
in the polymarker representation selected by
the current polymarker index.
In this case, the marker size scale factor set with \s-2SET MARKER
SIZE SCALE FACTOR\s+2 has no effect.
.SH ERRORS
