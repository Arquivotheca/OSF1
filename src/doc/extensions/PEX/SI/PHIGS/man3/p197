.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2INQUIRE PREDEFINED PATTERN REPRESENTATION PLUS\s+2
inquires 
a predefined extended pattern representation for a
specified workstation type.
.SS C Input Parameters
Applications using the \s-2C\s+2 binding must create a buffer to be used by this
function as memory space for storing data associated with the device state.
This buffer is passed as the \fIstore\fP argument.  
.LP
The store buffer is a data area managed by \s-2PHIGS\s+2. While the application 
is responsible for creating the inital buffer through a call to \s-2\CREATE STORE\s+2, 
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 manages this area such that there is sufficient memory for the 
specific inquiry. The data record within the store buffer is accessed 
by the pointer pointed to by \fIrep\fR.
.\" All of the following data types are predefined in phigs.h.
.IP \fItype\fP
The workstation type.
.IP \fIindex\fP
Index of the predefined entry to be returned.
.IP \fIstore\fP
The memory buffer \s-2PHIGS\s+2 is to use for storing the information
returned.  
This buffer must exist prior to calling this function (see
\s-2CREATE STORE (3P)\s+2).
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIrep\fP
A pointer to a pointer to a Ppat_rep_plus structure that returns the
requested representation.

.SS Execution
.LP
If the inquired information is available, the error indicator is returned
as zero and values are returned in the output parameters.
.LP
If the inquired information is not available, the values returned in the
output parameters are undefined and the error indicator is
set to one of the following error numbers to indicate the reason for
nonavailability.
.LP
Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not invoked
when an error is detected by this function.
.SH ERRORS
