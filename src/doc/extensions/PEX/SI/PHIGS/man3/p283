.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET ANNOTATION TEXT CHARACTER HEIGHT\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the current annotation text character height 
attribute, which defines the height of a capital letter, in Text Local 
Coordinates.  
This attribute applies to the output primitives:
.RS
.LP
\(bu
.SM "ANNOTATION TEXT RELATIVE"
.LP
\(bu
.SM "ANNOTATION TEXT RELATIVE 3"
.RE
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2,
a \s-2SET ANNOTATION TEXT CHARACTER HEIGHT\s+2 element is inserted in 
the currently open structure after the element pointed to by the current 
element pointer.  If the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, then the new 
\s-2SET ANNOTATION TEXT CHARACTER HEIGHT\s+2 element
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer.  In either case, the
element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIheight\fP
A real value specifying the annotation text character height.
.SS Execution
When the \s-2SET ANNOTATION TEXT CHARACTER HEIGHT\s+2 element is traversed,
the current annotation text character height entry in the traversal state list 
is set to \s-2SET ANNOTATION TEXT CHARACTER HEIGHT\s+2.  
Characters in text output primitives that follow in the structure network
are drawn with the current annotation text character height.  
.LP
The annotation text character height is specified in 
Text Local Coordinates (TLC) and determines the height of a capital letter,
measured from the character base line parallel to the \fIcharacter up vector\fP.  
The character base line and character up vector are relative to the
TLC system created by the reference point and annotation offset
specified in the annotation text relative output primitive.  
.LP
The default annotation text character height is 0.01.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2STOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
