.SS Execution
In the pattern table of the workstation state list, the given
index is associated with the specified parameters.
.LP
A grid of \fI\s-2DX\s+2\fP by  \fI\s-2DY\s+2\fP cells is specified with 
\fI\s-2DX\s+2\fP
being horizontal and \fI\s-2DY\s+2\fP being vertical. If the colour type 
is indirect colour, then colour is given individually for each cell
by the colour index, which is an index into the colour table of 
the workstation. Otherwise, the colour is given individually for
each cell by a direct colour value in the specified colour model.
.LP
If the workstation supports interior style \s-2PATTERN\s+2, the pattern
table in the workstation state list has predefined entries taken from
the workstation description table. A number of these entries are predefined
for every workstation of category \s-2OUTPUT\s+2 and \s-2OUTIN\s+2
supporting interior style \s-2PATTERN\s+2. Any table entry, including
the predefined entries, may be redefined with this function.
.LP
When area-defining primitives are displayed during structure traversal,
if the currently selected interior style is \s-2PATTERN\s+2, the current
or back interior style index in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2
state list
refers to an entry in the extended pattern table. The selection is made
either via the interior bundle or individually, depending on the
corresponding Aspect Source Flags(\s-2ASF\s+2s). If the
current or back interior style index is not present in the extended 
pattern table, then interior style index one is used. If interior style
index one is not present, the result is workstation dependent and the
interior style \s-2PATTERN\s+2 is not supported for this workstation.
The setting of the corresponding \s-2ASF\s+2s determines which 
aspects in the entry are used.
.LP
During structure traversal, if the colour type of a specified pattern
table entry is indirect colour and if a pattern colour index specified
in the pattern colour array is not available on the workstation, then 
colour index one is used.
.RE
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, WSOP, *, *\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(that is, the workstation category is neither \s-2OUTPUT\s+2,
\s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 103
Ignoring function, setting this bundle table entry would exceed the maximum
number of entries allowed in the workstation bundle table
.IP 110
Ignoring function, the specified colour model is not available on the
workstation
.IP 112
Ignoring function, the pattern index value is less than one
.IP 113
Ignoring function, the colour index value is less than zero
.IP 116
Ignoring function, one of the dimensions of the pattern colour array
is less than one
.IP 136
Ignoring function, one of the components of the colour specification
is out of range
