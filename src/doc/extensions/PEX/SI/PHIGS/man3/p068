.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2GET PICK\s+2 retrieves the current event report from the \s-2PHIGS\s+2
state list when the event report contains a \s-2PICK\s+2 event.
A \s-2PICK\s+2 event consists of a status and a pick path.
The status indicates whether or not a pick by the operator successfully
selected an ouput primitive.
The pick path describes the location of the picked primitive, if any,
in the Central Structure Store (\s-2CSS\s+2).
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIdepth\fP
The maximum number of pick path elements to return.
This may be more or less than the actual path depth in the current event
report.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIin_status\fP
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 sets the variable pointed to by \fIin_status\fP to 
the event's pick status.
A value of \s-2PIN_STATUS_OK\s+2 indicates that an output primitive was successfully
selected by the operator.
A value of \s-2PIN_STATUS_NONE\s+2 indicates that a pick was attempted but no
primitive was selected.
Pin_status is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.nf
typedef enum {
.sp .2
.ta .5i
	PIN_STATUS_NONE,
	PIN_STATUS_OK,
	PIN_STATUS_NO_IN
.sp .2
} Pin_status;
.sp
.fi
The value \s-2PIN_STATUS_NO_IN\s+2 will not be returned by this function.
That value is for use with \s-2REQUEST PICK\s+2.
.IP \fIrpick\fP
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 sets the variable pointed to by \fIrpick\fP to 
the events's pick path.
Ppick_path is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Ppick_path_elem     'u +\w'pick_path;     'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	depth;	/* pick path_list depth */
	Ppick_path_elem	*path_list;	/* pick path */
.sp .2
} Ppick_path;
.sp
.fi
.IP
A pick path is only returned if the status is \s-2PIN_STATUS_OK\s+2.
The contents of \fIrpick\fP are not changed if the status is not
\s-2PIN_STATUS_OK\s+2.
The pick path depth indicates the number of elements in the event's pick
path as stored in the current event report.
It is not affected by the \fIdepth\fP input parameter;
therefore, the number of elements returned in \fIpath_list\fR may be less than
depth.
.IP
\fIpath_list\fR is an array of references defining the
location of the picked primitive in the \s-2CSS\s+2.
\fBThis array must be allocated by the calling program
and the array pointer assigned to this field before calling this
function.\fP
The array must be at least long enough to hold the number of path elements
indicated by the \fIdepth\fP input parameter.
Ppick_path_elem is defined in phigs.h as:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'struct_id;     'u
.nf
typedef struct {
	Pint	struct_id;	/* structure identifier */
	Pint	pick_id;	/* hierarchical pick identifier */
	Pint	elem_pos;	/* element sequence number */
} Ppick_path_elem;
.sp
.fi
.IP
The \fIstruct_id, pick_id,\fR and \fIelem_pos\fR
are the structure identifier, pick id, and element number, respectively,
of each element in the path.
Each element but the last indicates the location and current pick id of
an \s-2EXECUTE STRUCTURE\s+2 structure element in the path to the selected
primitive.  The last element in the path indicates the location and current
pick id of the selected output primitive.
.fi
.SS Execution
.LP
\s-2GET PICK\s+2 retrieves the contents of a \s-2PICK\s+2
event from the current event report in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 state list.
If \s-2PIN_STATUS_OK\s+2 is returned as the status,
the returned pick path contains the portion of the event's pick path
requested, as specified by the \fIdepth\fP input parameter.
The pick path will be in either top-first or bottom-first order depending
upon the value specified when the device was initialized.
.LP
When an input device in \s-2EVENT\s+2 mode is triggered
by the operator,
an event report is added to the input event queue if the queue is not full.
The event report contains the identity and current measure of the triggered
device.
\s-2AWAIT EVENT\s+2 moves the measure of the oldest event in the input queue
to the current event report in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 state list.
If the event was a \s-2PICK\s+2 event, \s-2GET PICK\s+2 is used to
retrieve the contents of the event from the current event report.
.LP
If the pick event was generated by the operator's successfully selecting
an output primitive, \s-2GET PICK\s+2 returns the status
\s-2PIN_STATUS_OK\s+2 and the pick path to the primitive selected.
If a primitive was not successfully selected, the status returned will be
\s-2PIN_STATUS_NONE\s+2 and no pick path is returned.
.LP
See \s-2INITIALIZE PICK 3\s+2 for a description of the available
\s-2PICK\s+2 devices and how their measure values are determined.
.LP
The \fIpick filter\fP of a \s-2PICK\s+2 device controls which output
primitives on the device's workstation are pickable.
By default no output primitives are pickable.
See \s-2SET PICK FILTER\s+2 for more information on the pick filter.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, WSOP, *, *\s+2)
.IP 259
Ignoring function, the input device class of the current input report
does not match the class being requested
