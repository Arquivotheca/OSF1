.SH NAME
LABEL \- create a structure element containing a label identifier

.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
The \s-2LABEL\s+2 subroutine puts a structure element containing a label identifier into the currently open structure. Labels are used to mark locations within a structure.
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, the \s-2LABEL\s+2 element is inserted into the currently open structure after the element currently pointed to by the element pointer. If the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the \s-2LABEL\s+2 element replaces the element pointed to. In either case, the element pointer is updated to point to the new \s-2LABEL\s+2 element.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIlabel_id \fP
The label identifier is used by other subroutines to reference the label element's location in the structure.
.SS Execution
The \s-2LABEL\s+2 element is a marker within the structure. When the structure is traversed, \s-2LABEL\s+2 elements are ignored.
.sp
\s-2LABEL\s+2 elements are used by the \s-2SET ELEMENT POINTER AT
LABEL\s+2 and \s-2DELETE ELEMENTS BETWEEN LABELS\s+2 subroutines to
identify locations within a structure. The labels allow you to locate an
element or group of elements even if structure editing changes
the numbering of elements within the structure.
For example, you may wish to bracket a sequence of
related elements in a structure with labels.
.sp
Label identifiers need not be unique in a structure. The search for a
label within a structure is always from the element after the current
position of the element pointer toward the end of the structure.
Subroutines which refer to labels reference the next occurrence of the
specified label within the structure. If the specified label is not found
before the end of the structure, an error is generated.
