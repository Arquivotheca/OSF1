.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \*f to inquire the specific workstation type and connection identifier
associated with a given workstation.  The connection identifier and
workstation type are associated with a workstation when it is opened.
At that time a \fIspecific workstation type\fP is created, based on the
generic type supplied by the caller, and the specific workstation type
and the user-supplied connection identifier are stored in the workstation's
state list.
This function returns that specific workstation type and the connection
identifier.
See \s-2OPEN WORKSTATION\s+2 for descriptions of the possible connection
identifiers and generic workstation types.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The workstation identifier of the workstation in question.
.IP \fIstring_length\fP
The size of the buffer (in bytes) pointed to by \fIconnid\fR for
the connection identifier to be returned in.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error detected by this function.
.IP \fIconn_id\fP
A pointer to a Pconnid (a pointer to the connection identifier).
.IP \fIws_type\fP
A pointer to a Pint variable in which to store the workstation type.
.
.SS Execution
\*f returns the specific workstation type and connection identifier
associated with the specified workstation.  See \s-2OPEN WORKSTATION\s+2
for a description of the possible connection identifiers and workstation
types.
.LP
Except in the case mentioned in the \s-2C\s+2 Parameters sections above,
if an error is detected by this function the \fIerror indicator\fP will
indicate the error number of the error detected and no other output data
will be returned.  If no error is detected, the \fIerror indicator\fP will
be set to zero and the inquired information will be available in the output
parameters.  Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not
invoked when an error is detected by this function.
