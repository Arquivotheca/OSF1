.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2UNPOST STRUCTURE\s+2 unposts a single structure from a
workstation.
The structure is not deleted from the Central Structure Store (\s-2CSS\s+2),
but it is no longer eligible for display on the workstation.
.LP
The immediate effect of the function on the display surface will
depend on the workstation's display update state.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws_id\fP
The structure is to be unposted from the workstation with this identifier.
.IP \fIstruct_id\fP
The identifier of the structure to be unposted.
.SS Execution
\s-2UNPOST STRUCTURE\s+2 removes the structure specified
from the table of posted structures on the workstation.
Unless the structure is part of a structure network posted to the workstation,
the structure is no longer eligible for display on the workstation,
and changes to the structure will no longer affect the workstation.
.LP
The structure is not deleted from the \s-2CSS\s+2 and may again
be posted to the same or another workstation.
Other workstations are unaffected.
.LP
If structure identifier is not listed in the table of posted structures or
does not exist in the \s-2CSS\s+2 when \s-2UNPOST
STRUCTURE\s+2 is called, the function takes no action.
.LP
The effect of unposting the structure may be immediately visible on the
workstation's display, depending on the
workstation's display update state.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, WSOP, *, *\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(i.e., the workstation category is neither \s-2OUTPUT\s+2, \s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
