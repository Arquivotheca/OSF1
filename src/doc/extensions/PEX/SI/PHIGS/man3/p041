.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
When the error handling mode is \s-2ON\s+2, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is
called by \s-2PHIGS\s+2 functions when they detect an error.
.LP
An application may replace the default \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2
function in order to modify the default response to errors, which is
simply to call \s-2ERROR LOGGING\s+2.
Any such replacement must have the name above and accept the same parameters.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIerrnum\fP
The number of the error detected. The error numbers and corresponding error
messages are listed with each function description in
this reference.
.IP \fIfuncnum\fP
The identification of the function that detected the error.
.IP \fIfname\fP
A pointer to a character string containing the name of the error file.
The error file is specified in the call to \s-2OPEN PHIGS\s+2.
.SS Execution
\s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is called by a \s-2PHIGS\s+2 function that
has deteced an error.
The default \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 function performs no
other processing than to call \s-2ERROR LOGGING\s+2.
.LP
See \s-2OPEN PHIGS\s+2 for a description of the \s-2PHIGS\s+2
interaction with the error file.
