.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE OPEN STRUCTURE\s+2 to determine the status of the currently open structure.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIstatus\fP
A pointer to a Popen_struct_status enumerated type in which the
system returns the status of the currently open structure.
Values of Popen_struct_status are defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'PSTRUCT_NONE     'u
.sp
	PSTRUCT_NONE	\fINo Structure Is Open\fP
	PSTRUCT_OPEN	\fIA Structure Is Open\fP
.fi
.IP \fIstruct_id\fP
An integer pointer in which the system returns the structure identifier of the currently open structure.
This value is undefined if \fIstatus\fP is \s-2PSTRUCT_NONE\s+2.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, *\s+2)
