.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET FACE CULLING MODE\s+2 creates a structure element
to set the face culling mode. The attribute face culling mode defines 
control over the visibility of front and back facing portions of area 
defining primitives. See \s-2SET FACE DISTINGUISHING MODE (3P+)\s+2 for details 
on front and back face determination.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fImode\fP
A pointer to a Pcull_mode structure. A Pcull_mode structure is
defined as:
.sp .4
.nf
.ta .5i
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PCULL_NONE,
	PCULL_BACKFACE,
	PCULL_FRONTFACE
.sp .2
} Pcull_mode;
.fi
.SS Execution
Depending on the edit mode, a \s-2SET FACE CULLING MODE\s+2
element is inserted into the open structure after the element pointer
or replaces the element pointed at by the element pointer. The element
pointer is then updated to point to this \s-2SET FACE CULLING MODE\s+2
element.
.LP
When face culling mode is \fINone\fP, both front and back facing
portions are visible. When face culling mode is \fIBackface\fP,
back facing portions are invisible. When it is \fIFrontface\fP,
front facing portions are invisible.
