.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE SET OF WORKSTATIONS TO WHICH POSTED\s+2 to obtain a list of workstations to which a specified structure is posted.
.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIstruct_id\fP
Identifier of the structure for which the list of workstations it
is posted to will be returned.
.IP \fIlength\fP
The number of \fIints\fP items in the \fIws\fP output parameter for
which the application has allocated memory.
\fIlength\fP is the number of list elements (workstation identifiers)
that the system can return in \fIints\fP.
If a value of 0 is used here, no data will be returned in the
\fIints\fP list, but the
total number of workstations the structure is posted to
will be returned in \fItotal_length\fP.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position of inquiry into the list of workstations
to which this structure is posted.
The elements of the list of workstation identifiers, beginning
with the item number specified by \fIstart\fP, are copied sequentially
into \fIints\fP until \fIints\fP
is full or all the workstation identifiers have been copied.
.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error detected
by this function.
.IP \fIws\fP
A pointer to a Pint_list structure in which the system returns the list of workstations to which \fIstruct_id\fP is posted.
Pint_list is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Pint     'u +\w'num_ints;     'u
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_ints;	/* number of Pints in list */
	Pint	*ints:	/* pointer to list of integers */
.sp .2
} Pint_list;
.fi
.IP
The \fInum_ints\fP component specifies the number of workstation identifiers
in the list. The \fIints\fP component is a pointer to a list,
\fInum_ints\fP long, of the workstation identifiers.
.IP
The application must allocate memory for \fIlength\fP elements in
the \fIints\fP list.
.IP \fItotal_length\fP
A pointer to an integer in which the system returns the 
total number of workstations to which the specified structure is posted.
This is the value required for
\fIlength\fP if the entire list is to be returned.
.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, *\s+2)
.IP 201
Ignoring function, the specified structure does not exist
