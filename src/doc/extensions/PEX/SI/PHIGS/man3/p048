.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\*f attempts to map a list of X drawable coordinate points to a list of
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 World Coordinate points using the views of the specified workstation.
This provides similar functionality to a \s-2PHIGS\s+2 stroke device, but uses
points provided by the application rather than directly by the operator.
The method used to map the points is the same one used by \s-2PHIGS\s+2 stroke
devices.

This escape is not associated with any \s-2PHIGS\s+2 input device and can be used
without initializing any \s-2PHIGS\s+2 input device.
It is intended to allow the application to implement its own stroke device
using the standard X Event mechanism.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIfunc_id\fP
The function identifier for this escape is \s-2PUESC_DRAWABLE_POINTS_TO_WC\s+2,
which is defined in phigs.h to be -5.
.IP \fIin\fP
A pointer to a Pescape_in_data union, which contains the escape_in_u5 member
used by this escape function.
This member is defined in phigs.h as:
.nf
.ta .5i +.75i +1i
.sp .4
struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	ws_id;	/* workstation identifier */
	Ppoint_list3	points;	/* x,y are drawable coords, z is DC*/
.sp .2
} escape_in_u5;	/* drawable points to WC */
.fi
.RS
.IP \fIws_id\fP
Indicates the workstation to use.  The views on this workstation will be
used in the conversion to World Coordinates.
mapping.
.IP \fIpoints\fP
The list of points to map.  The x and y coordinates are drawable coordinate
values, as typically provided by X events.  
The Z coordinate is a \s-2PHIGS DC Z\s+2 value.
Ppoint_list3 is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +.75i +1i
.sp .4
struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_points;	/* number of Ppoint3s in the list */
	Ppoint3	*points;	/* list of points */
.sp .2
} Ppoint_list3
.fi
Ppoint3 is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +.75i +1i
.sp .4
struct {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	x;	/* x coordinate */
	Pfloat	y;	/* y coordinate */
	Pfloat	z;	/* z coordinate */
.sp .2
} Ppoint_list3
.fi
.RE
.IP \fIstore\fP
This parameter is not used in this escape function.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIout\fP
A pointer to a pointer to a Pescape_out_data union, which contains the escape_out_u5
member used by this escape function.
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 copies a pointer to the converted points, if any, to this member
of the Pescape_out_data union.
This member is defined in phigs.h as:
.nf
.ta .5i +1.2i  +1.5i
.sp .4
struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	view_index;
	Ppoint_list3	points;
.sp .2
} escape_out_u5;
.fi
.IP
\fIview_index\fP
The index of the highest priority view that contains all the points and is
used to transform the points to World Coordinates.
The view index is only meaningful if the number of points returned is
greater than zero.
.IP
\fIpoints\fP
The World Coordinate points.
The points array in this structure must be allocated prior to calling this
function and must be large enough to hold at least the number of points
specified in the input parameters.
The number of points returned will be 0 if the input points do not all lie
within one of the workstation's current view representations.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state (PHOP, WSOP, *, *)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
