.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET INTERIOR COLOUR INDEX\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the current interior colour index attribute.
.LP
When the current interior colour index Aspect Source Flag (\s-2ASF\s+2)
is set to \s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2,
this attribute indexes the current colour representation
that applies to the following output primitives:

.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIindex\fP
An integer colour index, which selects a colour value from
the workstation's colour table.
.SS Execution
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2,
a \s-2SET INTERIOR COLOUR INDEX\s+2 element is inserted
into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the
current element pointer. If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2,
then the new \s-2SET INTERIOR COLOUR INDEX\s+2 element
replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer.
In either case, the element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.LP
When the \s-2SET INTERIOR COLOUR INDEX\s+2 element is traversed,
the current interior colour index
entry in the traversal state list is set to the colour index.
.LP
When the interior colour index \s-2ASF\s+2 
is set to
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2, the fill area output primitives that follow in
the structure network are filled with the colour representation
selected by the current interior colour index from the workstation's
colour table.
.LP
If the colour index specified is not available on the workstation,
colour index 1 is used.
.LP
When the current interior colour index \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to \s-2BUNDLED\s+2,
the interior colour index is taken from the
workstation's representation indicated by the current interior index.
In this case, the colour index set with \s-2SET INTERIOR COLOUR INDEX\s+2
has no effect.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state 
(\s-2PHOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2, \s-2STOP\s+2, \s-2*\s+2)
.IP 113
Ignoring function, the colour index value is less than zero
