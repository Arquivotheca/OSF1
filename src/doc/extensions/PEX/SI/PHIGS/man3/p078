.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INITIALIZE LOCATOR 3\s+2 to set the initialization parameters of a
\s-2LOCATOR\s+2 device.
This function stores these parameters in the workstation state list
of the workstation associated with the device.
The specified \fBdevice must be in \s-2REQUEST\s+2 mode\fP when this
function is called.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The workstation identifier of the workstation associated with the device.
.IP \fIdev\fP
The device number of the \s-2LOCATOR\s+2 device to initialize.
See the \fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section below for a description of the
available devices.
.IP \fIinit_view_ind\fP
The index of the view representation in the
workstation's view table to use to map the specified initial position
from World Coordinates (\s-2WC\s+2) to Normalized Projection Coordinates (\s-2NPC\s+2).
.IP \fIinit_loc_pos\fP
A Ppoint3 structure specifying the initial locator position, in World
Coordinates.
Ppoint3 is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +1i  +1i
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	x;	/* x coordinate */
	Pfloat	y;	/* y coordinate */
	Pfloat	z;	/* z coordinate */
.sp .2
} Ppoint3;
.fi
.IP \fIpet\fP
The prompt/echo type desired.
Those supported by each device are listed in the
\fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section below.
.IP \fIecho_volume\fP
A pointer to a Plimit3 structure specifying the
echo volume, in Device Coordinates (\s-2DC\s+2).
Plimit3 is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +1i  +1i
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	x_min;	/* minimum x coordinate value */
	Pfloat	x_max;	/* maximum x coordinate value */
	Pfloat	y_min;	/* minimum y coordinate value */
	Pfloat	y_max;	/* maximum y coordinate value */
	Pfloat	z_min;	/* minimum z coordinate value */
	Pfloat	z_max;	/* maximum z coordinate value */
.sp .2
} Plimit3;
.sp
.fi
.IP \fIrecord\fP
A pointer to a Ploc_data3 union containing the data record information.
The contents of the data record for each device and prompt/echo type are
described below in the \fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section.
.IP
The members of the data record union correspond to the prompt/echo type
being used.
As an example, the appropriate member of the Ploc_data3 union for
prompt/echo type 1 is \fIpet_r1\fP.
.IP
For some prompt/echo types the locator data record is not used;
however, the \fIrecord\fP parameter must still be supplied.
.SS Execution
.LP
\s-2INITIALIZE LOCATOR 3\s+2 sets the initialization parameters of a
\s-2LOCATOR\s+2 device.
This function stores these parameters in the workstation state list
of the workstation associated with the specified device.
The specified device must be in \s-2REQUEST\s+2 mode when this
function is called.
.LP
The parameters that are initialized by this function are 
\fIinitial value\fP,
\fIprompt/echo type\fP,
\fIecho volume\fP,
and
\fIinput data record\fP.
.LP
The \fIinitial value\fP is the logical input value the device will be
set to whenever it is enabled.
The device's measure retains this value until operator input changes it.
A device is enabled when the appropriate \s-2\fIREQUEST\fP\s+2
function is called,
or when its input mode is set to \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 or \s-2EVENT\s+2.
.LP
A \s-2LOCATOR\s+2 device measure consists of a \fIposition\fP and a
\fIview index\fP.
\fIPosition\fP is the World Coordinate (\s-2WC\s+2) point corresponding to the
position on the workstation selected by the operator.
The \fIview index\fP is the index of the view representation used to
transform the locator position from Normalized Projection
Coordinates (\s-2NPC\s+2) to \s-2WC\s+2.
This view representation is determined by selecting the highest priority
representation that contains the locator position within its \s-2NPC\s+2 limits.
See \s-2SET VIEW TRANSFORMATION INPUT PRIORITY\s+2 for more information.
The workstation transform is used to transform the operator-selected
position from Device Coordinates (\s-2DC\s+2) to \s-2NPC\s+2.
.LP
The initial locator position is transformed to \s-2DC\s+2 by
applying the view-orientation and view-mapping transforms of the specified
view representation, and then applying the workstation transformation.
If the view index is invalid, an error is generated.
.LP
The \fIprompt/echo type\fP determines how the device will be presented to
the operator and respond to his actions.
Each device supports one or more prompt/echo types.
Those supported by each device are listed in the device's
description in the \fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section below.
All devices support prompt/echo type 1.
Positive prompt/echo types are defined by the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 standard.
Negative types are implementation-dependent.
.LP
The \fIecho volume\fP defines the region of the display surface in which to
echo the device.
It is specified in \s-2DC\s+2.
Devices that use the echo volume may restrict their display to this
region.
Some of these devices will still recognize operator input
outside the region even though they don't display there.
.LP
The \fIinput data record\fP contains the prompt/echo type specific
information that controls the device's appearance and characteristics.
Not all the data record contents are used by some devices.
The device descriptions in the \fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section below
list the data record contents that each device recognizes.
.LP
All the initialization parameters must be specified properly or this function
will generate an error.
The \s-2\fIERRORS\fP\s+2 section below lists the possible error conditions.
.LP
The default initialization parameters and the list of prompt/echo types
supported by a \s-2LOCATOR\s+2 input device can be inquired with the function
\s-2INQUIRE DEFAULT LOCATOR DEVICE DATA 3\s+2.
The current state of the device can be inquired with the function
\s-2INQUIRE LOCATOR DEVICE STATE 3\s+2.
.SH AVAILABLE DEVICES
.SS Devices 1 to 3 - "Pointer devices"
.LP
These devices are associated with the X pointer device, usually the mouse and cursor.
Devices 1, 2, and 3 are triggered by the left, middle, and right mouse buttons respectively.
The locator position in the \s-2\fILOCATOR\fP\s+2 device's measure is the 
\s-2WC\s+2 position corresponding to the pointer position in X pointer events.
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 computes the \s-2WC\s+2 position from the two-dimensional pointer position by
transforming the pointer position to a \s-22D\s+2 \s-2NPC\s+2 point,
determining the highest priority view containing that point,
setting the \fIZ\fP coordinate of the \fINPC\fP point to the lower \fIZ\fP limit
of that view, and transforming the \fINPC\fP point to world coordinates.
.LP
Not all prompt/echo types use the initial locator position.
Only those that need an additional point to the current pointer position use
the initial position.
The pointer is not moved to the initial position when the device is
enabled.
.LP
This device does not use the echo volume.
.LP
\fBPrompt/echo types supported\fP:
.IP "PET 1" .8i
Display the default cursor at the current locator position.
.IP
The data record is not used for this \s-2PET\s+2.
