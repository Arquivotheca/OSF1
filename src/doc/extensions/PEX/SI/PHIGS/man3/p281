.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET ANNOTATION STYLE\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the current annotation style attribute,
which defines the height of a capital letter in Text Local Coordinates.
This attribute applies to the output primitives

If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2,
a \s-2SET ANNOTATION STYLE\s+2 element is inserted into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer.  If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, the new \s-2SET ANNOTATION STYLE\s+2
element replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer.  In either 
case, the element pointer is updated to point to the new element.  
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIstyle\fP
An integer value specifying one of the following annotation styles:
.nf
.ta .5i +.5i +2.25i
.sp .2
	1	PANNO_STYLE_UNCONNECTED	\fIUnconnected\fP
	2	PANNO_STYLE_LEAD_LINE	\fILead Line\fP
.sp .2
.fi
.SS Execution
When the \s-2SET ANNOTATION STYLE\s+2 element is traversed,
the current annotation style entry in the traversal state list is 
set to \fIannotation style\fP.  
Characters in text output primitives that follow in the structure network
are drawn with the current annotation style.
.LP
The \fILead Line\fP value means that the annotation text is connected to its
reference point by a lead line drawn using the current polyline attributes.
