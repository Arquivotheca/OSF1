.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INITIALIZE VALUATOR\s+2 to set the initialization parameters of a
\s-2VALUATOR\s+2 device.
This function stores these parameters in the workstation state list
of the workstation associated with the specified device.
The specified \fBdevice must be in \s-2REQUEST\s+2 mode\fP when this
function is called.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The workstation identifier of the workstation associated with the device.
.IP \fIdev\fP
The device number of the \s-2VALUATOR\s+2 device to initialize.
See the \fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section below for a description of the
available devices.
.IP \fIinit\fP
The initial valuator value.
.IP \fIpet\fP
The prompt/echo type desired.
Those supported by each device are listed in the
\fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section below.
.IP \fIecho_area\fP
A pointer to a Plimit structure defining the
\fIx\fP and \fIy\fP
components of the echo volume, in Device Coordinates (\s-2DC\s+2).  
The existing \fIz\fP component in the workstation state list is left unchanged.
Plimit is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.\" Plimit
.sp .4
.ta .5i +1i  +1i
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	x_min;	/* minimum x coordinate value */
	Pfloat	x_max;	/* maximum x coordinate value */
	Pfloat	y_min;	/* minimum y coordinate value */
	Pfloat	y_max;	/* maximum y coordinate value */
.sp .2
} Plimit;
.fi
.IP \fIrecord\fP
A pointer to a Pval_data structure containing the data record information.
The contents of the data record for each device and prompt/echo type are
described below in the \fIAvailable Devices\fP section.
.IP
Some members of the data record correspond to the prompt/echo type
being used.
As an example, the appropriate member of the Pval_data structure for
prompt/echo type 1 is
\fIpet_r1\fP.
.IP
For some prompt/echo types the data record is not used.
The \fIrecord\fP parameter, however, must still be passed.
.IP
Pval_data is defined in phigs.h as:
.bp
.ta .5i +1.5i  +1.25i
.nf
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	low;            /* low range limit */
	Pfloat	high;           /* high range limit */
	union {
	    struct {
	          Pint	unused;
	    } pet_r1;
	    struct {
	          Pchar	*label;	/* the device label widget string */
	          Pchar	*format;	/* the current value widget format string */
	          Pchar	*low_label;	/* the low value widget format string */
	          Pchar	*high_label;	/* the low value widget format string */
	    } pet_u1;

.SS Execution
.LP
\s-2INITIALIZE VALUATOR\s+2 sets the initialization parameters of a
\s-2VALUATOR\s+2 device.
This function stores these parameters in the workstation state list
of the workstation associated with the specified device.
The specified device must be in \s-2REQUEST\s+2 mode when this
function is called.
.LP
The parameters that are initialized by this function are 
\fIinitial value\fP,
\fIprompt/echo type\fP,
\fIecho volume\fP,
and
\fIinput data record\fP.
.LP
The \fIinitial value\fP is the logical input value the device will take on
whenever it is enabled.
The device's measure will retain this value until operator input changes it.
A device is enabled when the appropriate \s-2REQUEST\s+2 function is called,
or when its input mode is set to \s-2SAMPLE\s+2 or \s-2EVENT\s+2.
.LP
A \s-2VALUATOR\s+2 device measure consists of a floating point number.
This number is between the device's low value and high value, inclusive.
.LP
The \fIprompt/echo type\fP determines how the device will be presented to
the operator and respond to his actions.  
Each device supports one or more prompt/echo types.  
Those supported by each device are listed in the device's
description in the \fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section below.  
All devices support prompt/echo type 1.  
Positive prompt/echo types are defined by the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 standard.  
Negative types are implementation-dependent.  
.LP
The \fIecho volume\fP defines the region of the display surface in which to
echo the device.  It is specified in \s-2DC\s+2.  
Devices that use the echo volume may restrict their display to this region.  
Some of these devices may still recognize operator input
outside the region even though they do not display there.  
This function specifies only the \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP components of the echo volume.  
The existing \fIz\fP component in the workstation state list is left unchanged.
.LP
The \fIinput data record\fP contains the prompt/echo type specific
information that controls the device's appearance and characteristics.
Not all of the data record contents are used by some devices.
The device descriptions in the \fIAVAILABLE DEVICES\fP section below
list the data record contents that each device recognizes.
.LP
All the initialization parameters must be specified properly,
or this function will generate an error.
The \s-2\fIERRORS\fP\s+2 section below lists the possible error conditions.
.LP
The default initialization parameters and the list of prompt/echo types
supported by a \s-2VALUATOR\s+2 input device can be inquired with the function
\s-2INQUIRE DEFAULT VALUATOR DEVICE DATA\s+2.
The current state of the device can be inquired with the function
\s-2INQUIRE VALUATOR DEVICE STATE\s+2.
.SH AVAILABLE DEVICES
.SS Device 1 - "Athena Scrollbar Widget"
.LP
The valuator device realization is a collection of widgets from the Athena 
widget set. It consists of a Shell widget, a Pane widget, 4 Label widgets 
and a Scrollbar widget. The Scrollbar is the item manipulated by the 
operator to change the valuator value. The four Label widgets display 
a label for the device and labels for each of the current value, low
value and high value of the device. The device label, current value 
and low value are all displayed (by default) to the left of the Scrollbar. 
The high value is displayed to the right. The Pane, Label, and Scrollbar 
widgets are children of the Shell widget.
.LP
Each of the four Label widgets has a character string associated with it
that indicates what to display in that widget.  The strings for the
current value, low value and high value widgets may contain printf(3)
format descriptors.  \s-2PEX-SI\s+2 will expand these descriptors with the
corresponding device value so that the value appears in the widget.
For example, if the low value widget string is ``the low value is %f'' and
the low value is 5, \s-2PEX-SI\s+2 will display the widget as ``the low value is 5.0''.
.LP
The echo volume is not used for this device.
.LP
\fBPrompt/echo types supported\fP: 1, -1
.IP "PET 1" .8i
Display the valuator item as specified above.
The string for the label widget is ``value.''
The strings for the current value, low value, and high value strings are all \fI%8.3g\fP.
(Use \s-2PET -1\s+2 if these values are not as desired.)
No data record is used with \s-2PET 1\s+2.
.IP "PET -1"
Display the valuator item as specified for \s-2PET 1\s+2
but with application-specified widget strings.
The label, low value, and high value strings are specified in the data record.

The fully qualified name of all widgets is
<appl_name>.workstation<ws_id>.valuator<dev_id>.<widget_name>, where
<appl_name> is the application name specified in the call to OPEN XPHIGS.
(This will be "phigs" if OPEN XPHIGS was not called.)
For example, phigs.workstation1.valuator1.pane is the name of the
pane widget of valuator device 1 on workstation 1.
