.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\*f redraws the specified list of regions of a \s-2PHIGS\s+2 workstation window
without updating the workstation state list.
This escape function is intended to provide a means for applications to
redraw the workstation window in response to X exposure events, without
updating the state of the workstation state list.
When this function is called the workstation redraws the specified
regions.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIfunc_id\fP
The function identifier for this escape is \s-2PUESC_REDRAW_REGIONS\s+2,
which is defined in phigs.h to be -6.
.IP \fIin\fP
A pointer to a Pescape_in_data union, which contains the escape_in_u6 member
used by this escape function.
This member is defined in phigs.h as:
.nf
.ta .5i +.75i +1i
.sp .4
struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	ws_id;		/* workstation id */
	Pint	num_regions;	/* number of regions */
	XRectangle	*regions;	/* the regions to redraw */
.sp .2
} escape_in_u6;	/* redraw regions */
.fi
.RS
.IP \fIws_id\fP
Indicates the workstation to redraw.
.IP \fInum_regions\fP
The number of regions specified.
.IP \fIregions\fP
The regions of the workstation window to redraw.
.RE
.IP \fIstore\fP
This parameter is not used in this escape function.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIout\fP
This parameter is not used by this escape.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
