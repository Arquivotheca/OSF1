.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2DELETE ALL STRUCTURES\s+2 to remove all the existing structures from the Central Structure Store.
.SS C Input Parameters
None
.SS Execution
The \s-2DELETE ALL STRUCTURES\s+2 subroutine removes all the existing structures from the Central Structure Store. To do this, \s-2DELETE ALL STRUCTURES\s+2 executes the \s-2DELETE STRUCTURE\s+2 function for each existing structure.  All structure identifiers and structure elements are deleted, with the exception of an open structure.
.LP
If a structure is open, \s-2DELETE ALL STRUCTURES\s+2 retains the structure with its current structure identifier, but removes all the structure elements from it. The result is to replace the open structure with an empty structure.
.LP
Any structure that is posted to a workstation is unposted.
