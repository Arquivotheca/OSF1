.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE POSTED STRUCTURES \s+2 to obtain the list of
currently posted structures from a workstation's state list.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The \fIworkstation identifier\fP of the workstation whose state list is queried.
.IP \fIlength\fP
The number of \fIpostings\fR in the \fIlist\fR output parameter for which the 
application has allocated memory. \fIlength\fR is the number of list elements
(posted structures) that the system can return in \fIlist\(->postings\fR.
If a value of 0 is used here, no data will be returned in the \fIlist\(->postings\fR
list, but the total number of posted structures in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 state list
will be returned in \fItotal_length\fR.
.IP \fIstart\fP
Starting position of inquiry into the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 state list of 
current structures. The elements of the list of posted structures, beginning
with the item number specified by \fIstart\fR, are copied sequentially into 
\fIlist\(->postings\fR until \fIlist\(->postings\fR is full or all the 
posted structures have been copied.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIlist\fP
A pointer to a Pposted_struct_list in which the system returns the portion of the
list of currently posted structures starting at the entry specified with \fIstart\fP.
Pposted_struct_list is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pposted_struct     'u +\w'num_postings;     'u
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	num_postings;	/* number of structure postings */
	Pposted_struct	*postings;	/* list of postings */
.fi
.sp .2
} Pposted_struct_list;
.IP
The pointer \fIlist\(->postings\fP must be initialized to an array of \fIlength\fP 
Pstructpost elements.  Pposted_struct is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pfloat     'u +\w'disp_pri;     'u
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint	id;	/* structure id */
	Pfloat	disp_pri;	/* structure priority */
.fi
.sp .2
} Pposted_struct;
.IP \fItotal_length\fP
A pointer to an integer in which the system returns the total number of elements
in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 state list of currently used posted structures. This is the value
required for \fIlength\fR if all posted structures are to be returned.
.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, WSOP, *, *\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(that is, the workstation category is neither \s-2OUTPUT\s+2,
\s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
