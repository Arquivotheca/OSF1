.SS Purpose
\s-2SET POLYMARKER REPRESENTATION PLUS\s+2 defines an
extended polymarker attribute bundle on a workstation.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The identifier of the workstation.
.IP \fIindex\fP
This is an index to the workstation marker bundle table.
.IP \fIrep\fP
A pointer to a Pmarker_bundle_plus structure. Pmarker_bundle_plus is defined as:
.sp .2
.nf
.ta .5i +1i  +1i  +1.5i
.sp .2
typedef struct {
.sp .2

	Pgcolr	colr;	/* marker colour */

} Pmarker_bundle_plus;

	          Pfloat	y;	/* green, saturation, lightness, etc. */

\fIrep->type\fP is an integer value specifying a \fImarker type\fP;
the following marker types are defined:
.nf

Support for marker types is workstation-dependent.
The \fIPoint\fP (\*(PT) marker type is always the smallest dot possible,
regardless of the marker size scale factor value applicable.  
.sp
\fIrep->size\fP is the \fImarker size scale factor\fP.  
.sp
\fIrep->colr\fP is the \fIpolymarker colour\fP,
which selects a colour value from the workstation's colour table.  
.SS Execution
In the polymarker bundle table of the workstation state list, the given
index is associated with the specified parameters.
.LP
The marker size scale factor is a scale factor applied to the nominal
marker size. During structure traversal, the scale factor is multiplied
by the nominal marker size on a workstation. The result is mapped by
the workstation to the nearest available marker size.
.LP
Polymarker colour is a general colour, either an indirect or a
direct colour in a specified colour model. If an indirect colour is
specified and the specified colour index is not available during
structure traversal, then colour index one is used.
.LP
The extended polymarker bundle table in the workstation state list has
predefined entries taken from the workstation description table. A
number of these entries are predefined for every workstation of category
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2 or \s-2OUTIN\s+2. Any table entry, including the predefined
entries, may be redefined with this function.
.LP
When polymarkers are displayed during structure traversal, the current
polymarker index in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 traversal state list
refers to an entry in the extended polymarker bundle table. If the
current polymarker index is not present in the extended polymarker
bundle table, then polymarker index one is used. The setting of the 
corresponding Aspect Source Flags(\s-2ASF\s+2s) determines which 
aspects in the entry are used.
.RE
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, WSOP, *, *\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output capability
(that is, the workstation category is neither \s-2OUTPUT\s+2,
\s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 100
Ignoring function, the bundle index value is less than one
.IP 103
Ignoring function, setting this bundle table entry would exceed the maximum
number of entries allowed in the workstation bundle table
.IP 105
Ignoring function, the specified marker type is not available on the 
specified workstation
.IP 110
Ignoring function, the specified colour model is not available on the 
workstation
.IP 113
Ignoring function, the colour index value is less than zero
.IP 136
Ignoring function, one of the components of the colour 
specification is out of range
