.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2INQUIRE PATTERN REPRESENTATION PLUS\s+2 
inquires an extended pattern representation on a workstation.
.SS C Input Parameters
Applications using the \s-2C\s+2 binding must create a buffer to be used by this
function as memory space for storing data associated with the device state.
This buffer is passed as the \fIstore\fP argument.  
.LP
The store buffer is a data area managed by \s-2PHIGS\s+2. While the application 
is responsible for creating the inital buffer through a call to \s-2\CREATE STORE\s+2, 
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 manages this area such that there is sufficient memory for the 
specific inquiry. The data record within the store buffer is accessed 
by the pointer pointed to by \fIrep\fR.
.IP \fIws\fP
The workstation identifier.
.IP \fIindex\fP
The pattern index.
.IP \fItype\fP
An enumerated value specifying whether the values to be returned are 
those originally specified by the application (\s-2PINQ_SET\s+2), or
those resulting after \s-2PHIGS\s+2 mapped them to ones available on the
workstation (\s-2PINQ_REALIZED\s+2).  A Pinq_type structure is defined as:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'PINQ_REALIZED     'u
.sp .4
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PINQ_SET,
	PINQ_REALIZED
.sp .2
} Pinqtype;
.fi
.IP \fIstore\fP
The memory buffer \s-2PHIGS\s+2 is to use for storing the information
returned.  This buffer must exist prior to calling this function (see
\s-2CREATE STORE (3P)\s+2).
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIrep\fP
A pointer to a pointer to a Ppat_rep_plus structure which returns the
specified extended pattern representation.
Ppat_rep_plus is defined as:
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pint_size     'u +\w'*colr_array;     'u
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pint_size	dims;	/* pattern's dimensions */
	Pint	type;	/* colour model */
	Pcoval	*colr_array;	/* array of colours */
.sp .2
} Ppat_rep_plus;
.fi
.IP
See \s-2SET PATTERN REPRESENTATION PLUS\s+2
for a full description of the contents of this structure.
.SS Execution
.LP
If the inquired information is available, the error indicator is returned
as zero and values are returned in the output parameters.
.LP
If the specified pattern index is not present in the pattern bundle table
on the workstation and the specified type of returned value is 
\fIRealized\fP,
the representation for pattern index one is returned.
.LP
If the inquired information is not available, the values returned in the
output parameters are undefined and the error indicator is
set to one of the following error numbers to indicate the reason for
non-availability.
.LP
Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not invoked
when an error is detected by this function.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, WSOP, *, *\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have output
capability (that is, the workstation category is neither \s-2OUTPUT\s+2,
\s-2OUTIN\s+2, nor \s-2MO\s+2)
.IP 101
Ignoring function, the specified representation has not been defined
.IP 109
Ignoring function, interior style \s-2PATTERN\s+2 is not supported on
the workstation
.IP 112
Ignoring function, the pattern index value is less than one
