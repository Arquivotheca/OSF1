.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET WORKSTATION WINDOW\s+2
defines the \s-2\&2D\s+2 area in Normalized Projection Coordinate 
(\s-2NPC\s+2) space to be displayed on the specified workstation.  
The workstation window is a rectangular box in \s-2NPC\s+2 space, 
which is mapped to the workstation viewport, defined in 
Device Coordinate (\s-2DC\s+2) space.  
.LP
Together, the workstation window and the workstation viewport
define the \fIworkstation transformation\fP that converts the image
from \s-2NPC\s+2 to \s-2DC\s+2 on the workstation's physical display surface.  
The workstation window defines what within \s-2NPC\s+2 space is displayed;  
the workstation viewport defines where the image is displayed in \s-2DC\s+2
space.  
.LP
Control of the workstation window allows you to choose
a portion of the abstract image
composed in \s-2NPC\s+2 space for display on the workstation,
without changing the definition of the image in \s-2NPC\s+2 space.  
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The identifier of the workstation for which the window is to be set.  
.IP \fIwindow\fP
A pointer to a structure containing the four \s-2\&2D\s+2 \s-2NPC\s+2
\fIworkstation window limits\fP,
defined as follows:  
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'Pfloat     'u +\w'x_max;     'u
.sp .4
typedef struct  {
.sp .2
	Pfloat	x_min;	/* x minimum */
	Pfloat	x_max;	/* x maximum */
	Pfloat	y_min;	/* y minimum */
	Pfloat	y_max;	/* y maximum */
.sp .2
} Plimit;
.fi
.SS Execution
.LP
The current workstation window defines the rectangular box in
Normalized Projection Coordinates (\s-2NPC\s+2) containing the portion of
the abstract image to be displayed within the current workstation viewport.  
Together, the workstation window and the workstation viewport
define an isotropic \fIworkstation transformation\fP that converts the image
from \s-2NPC\s+2 to \s-2DC\s+2 on the workstation's physical display surface.  
.LP
The range for each of the workstation window limits is [0,1].  
In addition, \fIx minimum\fP must be less than \fIx maximum\fP, and
\fIy minimum\fP must be less than \fIy maximum\fP.  
Output is automatically clipped at the workstation window limits, and
this clipping cannot be disabled.
.LP
\s-2SET WORKSTATION WINDOW\s+2 sets the \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP
components of the requested workstation window in the specified
workstation's state list to the values specified.  The \fIz\fP component
of the requested workstation window and current workstation window is
not changed.  The effect of calling \s-2SET WORKSTATION WINDOW\s+2 is
visible only after the requested workstation window replaces the
current workstation window.  The time at which this occurs depends on
the workstation's display update state.  This action is performed
immediately, and the \fIworkstation transformation update state\fP is set to
\s-2NOTPENDING\s+2, if any one of the following is true:  
.sp .5v
.in +0.5i
.ta +0.2i
.ti -0.2i
\(bu	The workstation's display update state allows update.
.sp .5v
.ti -0.2i
\(bu	The workstation's modification mode is any value other than
\fINo Immediate Visual Effect\fP,
and the \fIdynamic modification accepted for workstation transformation\fP 
entry in the workstation description table is set to Immediate.
.sp .5v
.ti -0.2i
\(bu	The \fIdisplay space empty\fP status in the workstation state list
is \s-2EMPTY\s+2.
.LP
Otherwise,
the workstation transformation update state is set to \s-2PENDING\s+2,
and the requested workstation window will not replace
the current workstation window until
the next time the workstation is updated.  
The workstation transformation update state will be set to \s-2NOTPENDING\s+2
at that time.  
.LP
If the current workstation window and viewport do not have the same aspect
ratios, the workstation transformation will preserve the proportions of the
image by mapping the workstation window to the largest possible area within
of workstation viewport so that: 
.sp .5v
.in +0.5i
.ta +0.2i
.ti -0.2i
\(bu	The aspect ratio of the window in \fIx\fP
and \fIy\fP is maintained.
.sp .5v
.ti -0.2i
\(bu	The lower left hand corner of the window
is mapped to the lower left hand corner of the viewport.
.LP
If the aspect ratios of the workstation window and viewport are different,
there will be unused space along the upper or
right-hand edges of the viewport, but not both.
.LP
The default workstation transformation maps the entire \s-2NPC\s+2 view plane,
[0,1] \(mu [0,1], onto the largest square in the
workstation display space including the display's lower left corner.  
.\"different:	The workstation transformation can be changed at any time after
.\"different:	the workstation is opened. However, changing the transformation
.\"different:	may cause an implicit regeneration of the picture regardless of
.\"different:	the explicit setting of the workstation's display update state.
