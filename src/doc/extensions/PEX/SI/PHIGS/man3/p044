.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\*f
enables or disables the enforced synchronization of error reporting.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIfunc_id\fP
The function identifier for this escape is \s-2PUESC_ERRSYNC\s+2,
defined in phigs.h to be -1.
.IP \fIin\fP
A pointer to a Pescape_in_data union, which contains the escape_in_u1 member
used by this escape function.
This member is defined in phigs.h as:
.sp .4
.ta .5i +\w'Perrsync     'u
.nf
struct {
.sp .2
	Perrsync	sync_on;
.sp .2
} escape_in_u1;
.fi
.RS
.IP \fIsync_on\fP
One of the following enumerated values:
.RS
.nf
.ta .25i +\w'-21 'u +\w'PERRSYNC_OFF     'u
.sp
	0	PERRSYNC_OFF	\fIAsynchronous Error Reporting\fP
	1	PERRSYNC_ON	\fISynchronous Error Reporting\fP
.sp

.IP \fIstore\fP
Not used.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIout\fP
There is no output data record for this escape.
.SS Execution
Errors detected by a \s-2PHIGS\s+2 function may not necessarily be
reported before that function returns to the application.
When this is the case, it is done to enhance performance.
When error reporting is delayed, all errors detected will eventually be
reported, but during a subsequent call to a PHIGS function.
When reported, each error will be correctly associated with the function
number of the function that detected the error.
.LP
Some applications may need to ensure that errors are reported
immediately. This can be indicated by \*f.
If the specified error synchronization mode is \s-2ON\s+2,
all errors detected by a \s-2PHIGS\s+2 function will be reported before
that function returns to the application.
If the error synchronization mode is \s-2OFF\s+2 (the default), errors
detected by a \s-2PHIGS\s+2 function will be reported either before that
function returns or
during a subsequent \s-2PHIGS\s+2 function call.
