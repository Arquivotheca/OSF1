.SH NAME
DELETE STRUCTURE \- remove specified structure

.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2DELETE STRUCTURE\s+2 removes the specified structure from the Central Structure Store \s-2(CSS)\s+2, along with all references to the structure and all postings 
of the structure to workstations.
.LP
If the specified structure is closed, the subroutine removes the structure elements, structure identifier, and any references to the structure.
.LP
If the structure is the currently open structure, the structure identifier is retained and remains open, but the structure contents and any references to the structure are deleted.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIstruct_id \fP
Specifies the structure to be deleted.
.SS Execution
The effect of \s-2DELETE STRUCTURE\s+2 when the specified structure
is closed at the time the subroutine is called is different from the
effect when structure identifier is the open structure.
The two situations are described below.
.sp .4
\fIDeleting a Closed Structure\fR
.sp .2
If structure identifier is not the currently open structure,
the \s-2DELETE STRUCTURE\s+2 subroutine removes the specified
structure from the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 Central Structure Store.
The subroutine deletes the structure identifier, structure contents,
and all references to structure identifier contained in other structures. 
.LP
If the currently open structure contains an element referencing structure
identifier, the element in the open structure is deleted and the remaining
elements renumbered.
If the element pointer is pointing to the deleted element,
the pointer is set to the preceding element.
If the element pointer is pointing to an element following the
deleted element, the element pointer is updated such that it
still refers to the same element.
.sp .4
\fIDeleting the Open Structure\fR
.sp .2
If structure identifier is the currently open structure, the result of \s-2DELETE STRUCTURE\s+2 is to replace the open structure with an empty, unreferenced structure. The effect is the same as calling the following subroutines in sequence:
