.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2DELETE ELEMENT RANGE\s+2 to delete all structure elements in the open structure between, and including, two specified element numbers.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIep1_value \fP
Specifies the beginning of the element range to be deleted.
.IP \fIep2_value \fP
Specifies the end of the element range to be deleted.
.SS Execution
The \s-2DELETE ELEMENT RANGE\s+2 subroutine removes structure elements
from the open structure between and including the lower and the higher
of the element positions specified by element pointer 1 value and
element pointer 2 value. The remaining elements in the structure are
renumbered and the element pointer is updated to point to the element
preceding the deleted elements.
.sp
If an element position is less than 1, the range of elements to be deleted will start from element position 0. If an element position is greater than the number of elements in the open structure, the range of elements to be deleted will end at the last element of the open structure.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, STOP, *\s+2)
