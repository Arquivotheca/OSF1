.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET BACK INTERIOR STYLE\s+2 creates a structure 
element to set the back interior style. \s-2SET BACK INTERIOR STYLE\s+2
determines in what style the interior of the back facing area defining
primitives should be filled: \fIHollow, Solid, Pattern, Hatch, Empty,\fP
or \fIGeneral\fP.
.LP
When the current back interior style Aspect Source Flag (\s-2ASF\s+2) is set to
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2,
the current value of this attribute
defines the back interior style to be applied to
the following output primitives:

A pointer to a Pint_style data structure.  A Pint_style structure
is defined in phigs.h as:
.sp .4
.nf
.ta .5i +\w'PSTYLE_HOLLOW,     'u
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PSTYLE_HOLLOW,	\fIHollow\fP	
	PSTYLE_SOLID,	\fISolid\fP
	PSTYLE_PAT,	\fIPatterned\fP
	PSTYLE_HATCH,	\fIHatched\fP
	PSTYLE_EMPTY,	\fIEmpty\fP
.sp .2
} Pint_style;
.fi
.SS Execution
Depending on the edit mode, a \s-2SET BACK INTERIOR STYLE\s+2
element with the value interior style is inserted into the open
structure after the element pointer,
or it replaces the element pointed at by the element pointer. The element
pointer is then updated to point to this \s-2SET BACK INTERIOR STYLE\s+2
element.
.LP
The back interior style is used to determine in what style the interior
of the back facing area-defining primitives should be filled:
.IP "\fIHollow\fP"
.IP
No filling, but draw the boundary using the colour, or colours, resulting
from the rendering pipeline. The linetype and linewidth of this bounding
polyline are implementation-dependent. \s-2PEX-SI\s0
presently uses a solid line of default width.
Clipping of fill areas yields visible edges at clip boundaries.
.IP "\fISolid\fP"
.IP
Fill the interior using the colour, or colours, resulting from the 
rendering pipeline.
.IP "\fIPattern\fP"
.IP
Fill the interior using the colours resulting from the rendering pipeline.
The current \s-2BACK INTERIOR STYLE INDEX\s+2 will be used to select a pattern
from the pattern table. In this context, the \s-2BACK INTERIOR STYLE INDEX\s+2
is sometimes referred to as the back pattern index and must have a value 
greater than zero.
.IP "\fIHatch\fP"
.IP
Fill the interior using the colours resulting from the rendering pipeline.
The current \s-2BACK INTERIOR STYLE INDEX\s+2 will be used to select a hatch
style from the hatch table. In this context, the \s-2BACK
INTERIOR STYLE INDEX\s+2
is sometimes referred to as the back hatch index.
.IP "\fIEmpty\fP"
.IP
No filling is performed. Area defining primitives drawn using this
value will be visible only if the \s-2EDGE FLAG\s+2 is set to \s-2ON\s+2.
.LP
If the requested interior style is not available on a workstation,
\fIHollow\fP will be used on that workstation.
.LP
Back face attributes (such as back area properties, 
back interior colour, back reflectance characteristics, 
back interior shading method, back interior style, and
back interior style index) are used only when the
face distinguishing mode has the value \fIYes\fP, and are applied only
to the back-facing portion of area-defining primitives. See 
\s-2SET FACE DISTINGUISHING MODE (3P+)\s+2 for details on front and back face 
determination.
.LP
When the current back interior style \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2, area-defining output primitives, which follow in
the structure network and are subject to back face attributes, are filled
using the current back interior style.
.LP
When the current back interior style \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to \s-2BUNDLED\s+2,
the back interior style is taken from the
workstation extended representation indicated by the current interior index.
In this case, the back interior style
set with \s-2SET BACK INTERIOR STYLE\s+2 has no effect.
