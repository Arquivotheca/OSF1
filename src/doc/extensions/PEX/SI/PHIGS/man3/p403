.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2WORKSTATION TYPE CREATE\s+2 creates a new workstation type.
The new type is a copy of an existing type, possibly changed by any
attribute-value pairs specified by the second parameter.
.LP
A new workstation type is created by an application to obtain a type with
different workstation description table values from those of an
existing workstation type.  The workstation description table values
can be changed by specifying the desired values to this function or by a
subsequent call to \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE SET\s+2, passing it the workstation
type created by \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE CREATE\s+2.
.LP
The workstation type returned from this function can be used anywhere a
workstation type parameter is specified.
When created, it is added to the list of available
workstation types in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 description table.
.LP
This is a \s-2PEX-SI\s0 addition, and is not
part of the 
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 standard.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIbase\fP
An existing workstation type from which to build the new type.
.IP \fIattributes\fP
A 0 terminated list of workstation type attributes and corresponding values.
As described in \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE SET\s+2, the workstation
description table fields of the new workstation type are modified according
to the contents of this list.
.SS C Output Parameters
If this function is successful, the new workstation type is returned as
the value of this function.
.SS Execution
The third argument to \s-2OPEN WORKSTATION\s+2 is a \fIworkstation type\fP.
Each workstation type has a \fIworkstation description table\fP
associated with it,
which contains both the \s-2PHIGS\s+2-specified data describing
workstation capabilities and some \s-2PEX-SI\s0-specific data describing
workstation characteristics.
The \s-2PEX-SI\s0-specific data, as well as some of the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 data,
can be changed by the application prior to opening a workstation.
\s-2WORKSTATION TYPE SET\s+2 describes the data that can be changed and how
to change it.
.LP
\s-2PEX-SI\s0 supplies a number of predefined workstation types.
These are described in \s-2OPEN WORKSTATION\s+2.
The predefined types cannot be operated on by \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE SET\s+2,
their description table values can not be changed.
Instead, it is necessary to create a new workstation type, based on one of
the predefined types, which can be modified by \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE SET\s+2.
Once created, the new workstation type can be used anywhere that
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 calls for a workstation type,
including the \fIbase type\fP parameter of this function.
The new type can be repeatedly edited by \s-2WORKSTATION TYPE SET\s+2 and
passed to \s-2OPEN WORKSTATION\s+2
This could be done, for instance,
to open workstations with only slightly
different description table values.
When the type is no longer needed it should be destroyed with
\s-2WORKSTATION TYPE DESTROY\s+2.
.LP
If a call to this function is successful the new workstation type will be
added to the \fIlist of available workstation types\fP in the \s-2PHIGS\s+2
description table.
