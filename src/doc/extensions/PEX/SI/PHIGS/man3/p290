.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET BACK INTERIOR STYLE INDEX\s+2 creates a structure 
element to set the back interior style index.
.LP
When the current back interior style index
Aspect Source Flag (\s-2ASF\s+2) is set to \s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2,
the current value of this attribute defines the back interior style index
to be applied to the following output primitives:

.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIindex\fP
The back interior style index.
.SS Execution
Depending on the edit mode, a \s-2SET BACK INTERIOR STYLE INDEX\s+2
element with the value interior style index is inserted into the 
open structure after the element pointer
or replaces the element pointed at by the element pointer. The element
pointer is then updated to point to this \s-2SET BACK INTERIOR STYLE INDEX\s+2
element.
.LP
During traversal, the back interior style index is used only for area-defining
facets that are back facing.
For interior styles \fIHollow\fP, \fISolid\fP, and \fIEmpty\fP,
the back interior style index value is not used.  For
interior style \fIPattern\fP, this value is greater than zero and is a
pointer into the pattern table of the workstation. For interior style
\fIHatch\fP, this value determines which of a number of hatch styles
is used. Hatch styles greater than zero are reserved for registration.
Hatch styles less than one are workstation-dependent.
.LP
At traversal time, if the entry associated with the specified interior
style index is not defined, then interior style index one is substituted. 
.LP
Back face attributes (such as back area properties, 
back interior colour, back reflectance characteristics, 
back interior shading method, back interior style, and
back interior style index) are used only when the
face distinguishing mode has the value \fIYes\fP and are applied 
only to the back facing portion of area defining primitives. See 
\s-2SET FACE DISTINGUISHING MODE (3P+)\s+2 for details on front and back face 
determination.
.LP
When the current back interior style index \s-2ASF\s+2 is set to
\s-2INDIVIDUAL\s+2, area-defining output primitives, which follow in
the structure network and are subject to back face attributes, are
filled using the current back interior style index.
.LP
When the current back interior style index
\s-2ASF\s+2 is set to \s-2BUNDLED\s+2,
the back interior style index is taken from the
workstation extended representation indicated by the current interior index.
In this case, the back interior style index
set with \s-2SET BACK INTERIOR STYLE INDEX\s+2 has no effect.
