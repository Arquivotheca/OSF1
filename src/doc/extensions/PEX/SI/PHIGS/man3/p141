.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE HLHSR MODE\s+2 to determine the current
\s-2HLHSR\s+2 (hidden line and hidden surface removal) mode
from a specified PHIGS workstation state list.
.LP
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIws\fP
The \fIworkstation identifier\fP of the workstation whose workstation state list
is queried.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerr_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIstate\fP
A pointer to a location in which the system returns the
\fI\s-2HLHSR\s+2 update state\fP.  Pupd_st is one of the values
\s-2PUPD_NOT_PEND\s+2 (\fINot Pending\fP) or \s-2PUPD_PEND\s+2 (\fIPending\fP).
.IP \fIcur_mode\fP
A pointer to a location in which the system returns the current
\fI\s-2HLHSR\s+2 mode\fP.
.IP \fIreq_mode\fP
A pointer to a location in which the system returns the \fIrequested
\s-2HLHSR\s+2 mode\fP. The requested mode can differ from the current mode
if the update state is
.SM PENDING.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 003
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, WSOP, *, *\s+2)
.IP 054
Ignoring function, the specified workstation is not open
.IP 057
Ignoring function, specified workstation is of category \s-2MI\s+2
