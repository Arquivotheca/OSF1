.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2OPEN XPHIGS\s+2 is similar to \s-2OPEN PHIGS\s+2 but allows
specification of additional run-time options.
It initializes the \s-2API\s+2 and enables access to the \s-2PHIGS\s+2
functions.
\s-2OPEN PHIGS\s+2 or \s-2OPEN XPHIGS\s+2 must be called prior to calling any
other \s-2PHIGS\s+2 functions.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fIerror_file\fP
A pointer to the \fIerror file\fP to log \s-2PHIGS\s+2 error messages to.
The \fIerror file\fP can be either a pointer to a
valid \s-2UNIX\s+2 file name or a null pointer, for example (char*)0.
A null pointer implies that standard error is to be used as the error file.
If a file name is specified, \s-2PHIGS\s+2 will attempt to access the file
for writing.  If this attempt fails, \s-2OPEN XPHIGS\s+2 will fail and the appropriate
error will be reported to standard error.
.IP
The error file argument passed to \s-2OPEN XPHIGS\s+2 will be passed to
\s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2.  \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 will also pass this argument to \s-2ERROR LOGGING\s+2.
If for some reason \s-2ERROR LOGGING\s+2 cannot access the specified error file,
the error message will be written to standard error.
\s-2ERROR LOGGING\s+2 appends messages to the error file; it does not truncate the file when
\s-2OPEN XPHIGS\s+2 is called.  If the specified file does not exist, it will only be
created if \s-2ERROR LOGGING\s+2 is called.
.IP 
\s-2ERROR LOGGING\s+2 writes the abstract \s-2PHIGS\s+2 function name, the
error number, and an error description to the error file.
If for some reason the text for the function name
and/or error description can't be determined, \s-2ERROR LOGGING\s+2
will just write the function number and the error number.
.IP \fImemory\fP
This parameter is not used by the \s-2PEX-SI API\s+2.
.IP \fIxinfo_mask\fP
A bitmask indicating which of the options are being set.
This mask is a bitwise OR of one or more of the valid option mask bits and
indicates which fields of the Pxphigs_info structure are set.

.IP \fIxinfo\fP
A pointer to a Pxphigs_info structure.
This structure is used to specify X-related options to \s-2PHIGS\s+2.
\fIxinfo\fP is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.nf
.ta .5i +.5i +1.0i +1.25i 
.sp .4
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Display		*display;	/* valid display pointer */
	XrmDatabase	rmdb;	/* a valid database */
	struct {
		char	*name;
		char	*class;
	} appl_id;		/* for resolving database attributes */
	struct {
		int	*argc_p;
		char	**argv;
	} args;			/* for merging args into specified database */
	struct {
		unsigned	no_monitor: 1;	/* 1 ==> monitor will not be executed */
		unsigned	force_client_SS;	/* 1 ==> always use client-side CSS */
	} flags;
.sp .2
} Pxphigs_info;
.sp .4
.fi
Only the fields indicated by \fIxinfo_mask\fP are examined.
.IP
\fIdisplay\fP specifies both the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 default server and the connection
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 is to use when communicating with it.
The \s-2PHIGS\s+2 default server holds the master copy of the
central structure store,
if it supports \s-2PEX\s+2 structure storage, and is where \fItool\fP
workstations are opened if their location is not specified to the
\s-2OPEN WORKSTATION\s+2 function.
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 uses the specified connection for all communication to the
default server,
even if a different connection is specified for a \fIdrawable\fP
workstation in a subsequent call to \s-2OPEN WORKSTATION\s+2.
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 uses the specified connection for the duration of the
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 session; it must not be closed before calling \s-2CLOSE PHIGS\s+2.
If \fIdisplay\fP is not specified, the default server will be the one
returned by a call to XDisplayName() with an argument of \s-2NULL\s+2.
.IP
\fIrmdb\fP an X resource database handle.
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 uses this database to build the default workstation description
tables.
Database searches are on the resource names and classes listed below.
Each search is qualified by the name and class specified in \fIappl_id\fP.
If \fIargs\fP are also specified \s-2PHIGS\s+2 will merge them into the database
prior to searching the database for resources PHIGS recognizes.
Any merged arguments will be removed from the argument list.
The resources \s-2PHIGS\s+2 recognizes are:
.sp .4
.ta 1.25i +1.25i +1.25i +.75i
.nf
\f(BIArgument String	Resource Name	Resource Class	Type	Valid Values\fP
-display	display	Display	String
-bufmode	bufMode	BufMode	String	single | double
=	geometry	Geometry	String
-label	label	Label	String
-iconlabel	iconLabel	IconLabel	String
.fi
.sp .4
The \fIdisplay\fR resource specifies the name of the default server.
The \fIbufMode\fR resource specifies the default buffering mode, ``single'' or
``double''.
The \fIgeometry\fR resource specifies the default window location and size for
\fIphig_ws_type_x_tool\fR workstation types.
The geometry is specified in the standard X geometry format:
.br
.ta .5i
	<width>x<height>{+-}<xoffset>{+-}<yoffset>.
.br
The \fIlabel\fR resource specifies the window label for
\fIphig_ws_type_x_tool\fR workstation types.
The \fIiconLabel\fR resource specifies the icon label for
\fIphig_ws_type_x_tool\fR workstation types.
.IP
\fIappl_id.name\fP and \fIappl_id.class\fP are the application name and
class to use when resolving resource database attributes.
If not specified, the name ``phigs'' and class ``Phigs'' are used.
.IP
\fIargs.argc_p\fP is a pointer to the argument count,
\fIargs.argv\fP is the array of command line arguments.
The arguments are searched for attributes recognized by \s-2PHIGS\s+2 and
are merged into the specified database, if any.
.IP
\fIflags.no_monitor\fP indicates whether the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 Monitor
(\s-2PM\s+2) is executed during popenphigs().
The \s-2PM\s+2 is a separate program started by
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 that handles window events and \s-2PHIGS\s+2 input for
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 workstations.
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 has complete control over this program; 
no user action is required to deal with it other than to indicate if it
should be used or not.
If the \s-2PM\s+2 is not executed (flags.no_monitor = 1), \s-2PHIGS\s+2 
will not monitor and respond to X window events nor will it provide any
\s-2PHIGS\s+2 workstations that support \s-2PHIGS\s+2 input devices.
All the predefined workstation types will be of category \s-2OUTPUT\s+2
(output only).
If the \s-2PM\s+2 is executed (flags.no_monitor = 0), \s-2PHIGS\s+2 will
monitor relevant window events and will provide predefined workstation types
of category \s-2OUTIN\s+2 (input and output).
.IP
\fIflags.force_client_SS\fP indicates whether the \s-2API\s+2 should use
client side structure storage even if server side structure storage is
available in \s-2X\s+2 servers with the \s-2PEX\s+2 extension.
\fIflags.force_client_SS\fP = 1 indicates that client side structure
storage should always be used.
\fIflags.force_client_SS\fP = 0 indicates that server side structure 
storage should be used if available.
.SS Execution
\s-2OPEN XPHIGS\s+2 sets internal state information 
and then calls popen_phigs().
