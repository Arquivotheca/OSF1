.TH "COPY ALL ELEMENTS FROM STRUCTURE" 3P "29 February 1991"
.SH NAME
COPY ALL ELEMENTS FROM STRUCTURE \-  copy elements of specified structure into open structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS C Syntax
.ft B
.ta 1.25i 3i
.nf
void
pcopy_all_elems_struct ( struct_id )
Pint	struct_id;	\fIstructure identifier\fP
.fi
.ft R
.SS Required PHIGS Operating States
(PHOP, *, STOP, *)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2COPY ALL ELEMENTS FROM STRUCTURE\s+2 copies the structure elements of 
the structure identifier into the currently open structure. The elements are copied into the open structure after the element pointed to by the element pointer.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIstruct_id \fP
Identifies the structure from which to copy the elements.
.SS Execution
The \s-2COPY ALL ELEMENTS FROM STRUCTURE\s+2 subroutine copies all the structure elements in the source structure identifier and inserts them into the currently open structure after the element pointed to by the element pointer. The element pointer is then updated to point to the last element inserted. The current edit mode has no effect on this subroutine.
.sp
If source structure identifier is the open structure, its contents are copied into itself after the element pointed to by the element pointer.
.sp
If source structure identifier refers to an empty structure or to a structure that does not exist, the subroutine does not perform any action and does not generate an error.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, STOP, *\s+2)
