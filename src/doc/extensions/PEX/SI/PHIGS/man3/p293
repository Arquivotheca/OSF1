.SH NAME
SET CHARACTER HEIGHT \- create structure element to set the \fIcurrent character height\fP attribute

.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
\s-2SET CHARACTER HEIGHT\s+2 creates a structure element
containing a value for the current character height attribute,
which defines the height of a capital letter, in Text Local Coordinates.  
This attribute applies to the output primitives:  
.LP
.RS
\(bu
.SM TEXT
.LP
\(bu
.SM "TEXT 3"
.RE
.LP
If the current edit mode is \s-2INSERT\s+2, then 
a \s-2SET CHARACTER HEIGHT\s+2 element is inserted into the currently open
structure after the element pointed to by the current element pointer.  If
the edit mode is \s-2REPLACE\s+2, then the new \s-2SET CHARACTER HEIGHT\s+2
element replaces the element pointed to by the element pointer.  
In either case, the element pointer is updated to point to the new element.
.SS C Input Parameter
.IP \fIheight\fP
A real value specifying the character height.
.SS Execution
When the \s-2SET CHARACTER HEIGHT\s+2 element is traversed, 
the current character height 
entry in the traversal state list is set to character height.  
Characters in text output primitives that follow in the structure network
are drawn with the current character height.  
.LP
The character height is specified in Text Local Coordinates (TLC) 
and determines the height of a capital letter,
measured from the character base line parallel to the character up vector.  
The character base line and character up vector are relative to the
Text Local Coordinate system created by the text position and text vectors
specified in the text output primitive.  
.LP
The default character height is 0.01.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 005
Ignoring function, function requires state
