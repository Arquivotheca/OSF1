.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Purpose
Use \s-2INQUIRE DYNAMICS OF WORKSTATION PLUS\s+2 to determine
dynamics of \s-2PHIGS PLUS\s+2 workstation attributes for a specified
workstation type.
.SS C Input Parameters
.IP \fItype \fP
The workstation type whose capabilities are inquired.
.SS C Output Parameters
.IP \fIerror_ind\fP
A pointer to the location to store the error number of any error
detected by this function.
.IP \fIattr \fP
A pointer to a structure in which the system returns the
dynamic modification accepted values for various
workstation attributes.
Pdyns_ws_attrs_plus is defined in phigs.h as follows:
.sp .4
.nf
.ta .5i +\1.0i +1.25i
typedef struct {
.sp .2
	Pdyn_mod	light_src_rep;	/* light source representation */
	Pdyn_mod	depth_cue_rep;	/* depth cue representation */
	Pdyn_mod	colr_map_rep;	/* colour mapping representation */
.sp .2
} Pdyns_ws_attrs_plus;
.fi
.IP
The Pdyn_mod is an enumeration defined in phigs.h as follows:
.ta .5i +1i +.25i
.nf
.sp .4
typedef enum {
.sp .2
	PDYN_IRG,	/* modification leads to an Implicit Regeneration */
	PDYN_IMM,	/* modification is performed Immediately, without an
			implicit regeneration */
	PDYN_CBS	/* modification Can Be Simulated before an implicit
			regeneration is permitted */
.sp .2
} Pdyn_mod;
.fi
.SS Execution
If the inquired information is available, the error indicator is
returned as zero and values are returned in the output parameters.
.LP
If the inquired information is not available, the values returned
in the output parameters are undefined and the error
indicator is set to one of the following error numbers to indicate
the reason for nonavailability.
.LP
Since this is an inquiry function, \s-2ERROR HANDLING\s+2 is not 
invoked when an error is detected by this function.
.SH ERRORS
.IP 002
Ignoring function, function requires state (\s-2PHOP, *, *, *\s+2)
.IP 051
Ignoring function, this information is not yet available
for this workstation type; open a workstation of this type
and use the specific workstation type
.IP 052
Ignoring function, workstation type not recognized by the implementation
.IP 059
Ignoring function, the specified workstation does not have
output capability (that is, the workstation category is not 
\s-2OUTPUT\s+2 or \s-2OUTIN\s+2)
.IP 062
Ignoring function, this information is not available for this
\s-2MO\s+2 workstation type
