.SH NAME
PHIGS TRAVERSAL STATE LIST \- contains all transient information
\s-2PEX-SI\s+2 uses
during traversal
.IX "PHIGS TRAVERSAL STATE LIST"
.IX "TRAVERSAL STATE LIST"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \s-2PHIGS\s+2 Traversal State List is created whenever a traversal is initiated,
and only exists during the traversal.
Hence, its values cannot be inquired.
Traversal is the execution of a structure network.
Traversal begins with a structure posted to a workstation.
Structure elements are traversed sequentially.
The traversal state list is modified by executing attribute elements. 
.LP
The initial values in the traversal state list are either 
defined by the \s-2PHIGS\s+2 standard, or are implementation
dependent.
These values are inherited by a posted structure.
Whenever an \s-2EXECUTE STRUCTURE\s+2 element is traversed,
the executed structure, or \fIchild\fP structure,
.I inherits
the attributes of the \fIparent\fP structure; that is, 
the structure invoking (executing or referencing) it.
Different parent structures can assign different attribute values.
.LP
The
.I child
structure's attributes are then modified by attribute elements as they
are sequentially executed.
The child structure may also execute
subordinate structures, at which point the calling structure is considered
the parent of this generation.
At the end of the child structure (i.e.,
after its last element), traversal returns to the parent structure,
restoring the saved state of the parent structure, and continues until the end of the
parent structure.
This continues until the entire structure network is
traversed (i.e., until traversal of the posted structure is complete).
The modifications to the child's structure do not affect the
parent structure's attributes.
Traversal state list values may be said to
.I expire
at the end of the structure in which they are set,
as traversal of the parent structure resumes.
.\".LP
.\"A called subroutine can use local variables with the same names as
.\"in the calling routine, and the values in the calling routine
.\"will not be affected. Similarly, an executed structure cannot
.\"affect its caller's attributes.
.LP
The values in the traversal state list are
.I bound
to primitives as the primitive elements are sequentially executed.
