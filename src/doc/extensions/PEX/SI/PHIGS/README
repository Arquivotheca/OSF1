		PEX-SI Graphics Library Manual Pages

The PEX-SI Graphics Library Manual Pages is a document made up of the 
Application Programmer's Interface functions.  Most of the functions are
PHIGS functions.  The new ISO IS C bindings have been incorporated.  

NOTE:  In order to make the PHIGS documentation portable to the majority 
of users we have shortened the names of the files containing the PHIGS 
function troff source.  To allow you to access the manual pages on-line 
via the function names, we have provided a shell script that will link 
the shortened file names to the longer function names.  See the descriptions
of man3/link_man3.sh and man7/link_man7.sh below.

This directory contains the following files and directories:

    Makefile:   A make(1) description file

    draft/:     A directory that contains the *.dit and *.ps files created 
		during the construction of the document.

 cover.phigs:     Troff source for the cover sheet.

    man3/:      The bulk of the troff source for the Graphics Library Manual
		Pages is kept here.  The file names have been shortened to
		the format <pnnn>, where nnn is the sequence number of the 
		function; the files have been numbered in the order in which 
		they appear in the printed document.  See man3/link_man3.sh below 
		for information on linking the short names to the long function 
		names.  You must link the files before you can access the 
		man pages on-line via the function names.

    man7/:      Troff source for the miscellaneous PHIGS reference manual
                pages.  These file names are also shortened to the <pnnn> 
		format.  See man7/link_man7.sh below.

    phigs.macros
		A version of the distributed man(7) macro package  
		that has been modified to include indexing and, thus,
		pagination.  This macro package should not be used
		for on-line display of man pages; it should only used
		to create the printed document.

    index.macros
		A set of macros that automate indexing of the bindings
		and functions

    names.make	A list of the man3/ and man7/ files used by the Makefile 
		to generate the document. 

   man3/link_man3.sh*
		A shell program that links the man3/ files to the long 
		function names.

   man7/link_man7.sh*
		A shell program that links the man7/ files to the long 
		function names.


The draft/ directory contains the postscript files you need to print the Graphics
Library Manual Pages.

	cover.ps -- The cover sheet
	doc.ps -- The chapter and appendix body pages.
	index.ps -- The index

On most systems you can use lpr to print the files.

The Makefile has the following targets:

	all --	Troffs all document files into dit files and places
		them in the draft/ directory.  (dit means `device independent 
		troff') It also creates an index.  The resultant files are 
		cover.dit, doc.dit, and index.dit. 

		Note: You will have to provide your own mechanism of converting
		the files to Post Script files if you are going to use the Makefile. 

       clean -- If you modify the text in anyway and want to `re-make' the
		document, you should first do a ``make clean'' before doing a 
		``make all''.  This target will remove all files created in
		the previous make.

       print --	Sends the dit files to the printer using the ditprint and ditsheet
		commands.  This target breaks the document up into 100 page increments
		so that it won't print 800+ pages in one shog.  If your system does
		not support ditprint or ditsheet you will need to modify the Makefile.
