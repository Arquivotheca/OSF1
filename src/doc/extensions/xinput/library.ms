Input Extension Overview
.XS
\*(SN Input Extension Overview
.XE
.LP
This document describes an extension to
the X11 server.  The purpose of this extension is to support the use
of additional input devices beyond the pointer and keyboard devices
defined by the core X protocol.  This first section gives an overview
of the input extension.  The following sections correspond to 
chapters 7 and 8, "Window Manager functions" and 
"Events and Event-Handling Functions" of the "Xlib - C Language Interface"
manual and describe how to use the input extension.
.NH 2
Design Approach
.XS
\*(SN Design Approach
.XE
.LP
The design approach of the extension is to define functions
and events analogous to the core functions and events. This allows
extension input devices and events to be individually distinguishable from each other 
and from the core input devices and events .  These functions and events make use
of a device identifier and support the
reporting of n-dimensional motion data as well as other data that
is not currently reportable via the core input events.
.NH 2
Core Input Devices
.XS
\*(SN Core Input Devices
.XE
.LP
The X server core protocol supports two input devices:  a pointer and a
keyboard.  The pointer device has two major functions. 
First, it may be used to generate motion information
that client programs can detect. Second, it may also be used to indicate the
current location and focus of the X keyboard.  To accomplish this, the server 
echoes a cursor at the current position of the X pointer.  Unless the X
keyboard has been explicitly focused, this cursor also shows the current
location and focus of the X keyboard.
.LP
The X keyboard is used to generate input that client programs can detect.
.LP
The X keyboard and X pointer are referred to in this document as 
the \fIcore devices\fP, and the input
events they generate (\fBKeyPress\fP, \fBKeyRelease\fP, \fBButtonPress\fP, 
\fBButtonRelease\fP, and
\fBMotionNotify\fP) are known as the \fIcore input events\fP.  All other
input devices are referred to as \fIextension input devices\fP and the 
input events they generate are referred to as \fIextension input events\fP.
.NT
This input extension does not change the behavior or functionality of the
core input devices, core events, or core protocol requests, with the
exception of the core grab requests.  These requests may affect the
synchronization of events from extension devices.  See the explanation
in the section titled "Event Synchronization and Core Grabs".
.NE
.LP
Selection of the physical devices to be initially used by the server as the 
core devices is left implementation-dependent.  Functions are defined that
allow client programs to change which physical devices are used as the
core devices.
.NH 2
Extension Input Devices
.XS
\*(SN Extension Input Devices
.XE
.LP
The input extension controls access to input devices other than the X keyboard
and X pointer.  It allows client programs to select input from these devices 
independently
from each other and independently from the core devices.  Input events from
these devices are of extension types (\fBDeviceKeyPress\fP, 
\fBDeviceKeyRelease\fP,
\fBDeviceButtonPress\fP, \fBDeviceButtonRelease\fP, \fBDeviceMotionNotify\fP, 
etc.) and contain
a device identifier so that events of the same type coming from different
input devices can be distinguished.
.LP
Extension input events are not limited in size by the size of the server
32-byte wire events.  Extension input events
may be constructed by the server sending as many
wire sized events as necessary to return the information required for
that event.
The library event reformatting routines
are responsible for combining these into one or more client XEvents.
.LP
Any input device that generates key, button or motion data may be used as
an extension input device.
Extension input devices may have 0 or more keys, 0 or more buttons,
and may report 0 or more axes of motion.  Motion may be reported 
as relative movements from a previous position or as an absolute
position.  All valuators reporting motion information for a given
extension input device must report the same kind of motion information
(absolute or relative).
.LP
This extension is designed to accommodate new types of input devices that
may be added in the future.  The protocol requests that refer to
specific characteristics of input devices organize that information
by \fBinput device classes\fP.  Server implementors may add new
classes of input devices without changing the protocol requests.
.LP
All extension input
devices are treated like the core X keyboard in determining their location
and focus.  The server does not track the location of these devices on an
individual basis, and therefore
does not echo a cursor to indicate their current location.
Instead, their location is determined by the location of the core X pointer.
Like the core X keyboard, some may be explicitly focused. If they are
not explicitly focused,  their focus
is determined by the location of the core X pointer.
.NH 3
Input Device Classes
.XS
\*(SN Input Device Classes
.XE
.LP
Some of the input extension requests divide input devices into classes
based on their functionality.  This is intended to allow new classes of input
devices to be defined at a later time without changing the semantics of 
these functions.  The following input device classes are currently
defined:
.RS
.in +10n
.IP "\fBKEY\fP"
The device reports key events.
.IP "\fBBUTTON\fP"
The device reports button events.
.IP "\fBVALUATOR\fP"
The device reports valuator data in motion events.
.IP "\fBPROXIMITY\fP"
The device reports proximity events.
.IP "\fBFOCUS\fP"
The device can be focused.
.IP "\fBFEEDBACK\fP"
The device supports feedbacks.
.in -10n
.RE
.LP
Additional classes may be added in the future.
Functions that support multiple input classes, such as the 
\fBXListInputDevices\fP function that lists all available input devices,
organize the data they return by input class.  Client programs that
use these functions should not access data unless it matches a 
class defined at the time those clients were compiled.  In this way,
new classes can be added without forcing existing clients that use
these functions to be recompiled.
.NH 2
Using Extension Input Devices
.XS
\*(SN Using Extension Input Devices
.XE
.LP
A client that wishes to access an input device does so through the library
functions defined in the following sections.  A typical sequence of requests
that a client would make is as follows:
.IP \(bu 3n
XListInputDevices - list all of the available input devices.  From the 
information returned by this request, determine whether the desired input
device is attached to the server.  For a description of the 
\fBXListInputDevices\fP request, see the section entitled
"Listing Available Devices".
.IP \(bu 3n
XOpenDevice -  request that the server open the device for access by this
client.  This request returns an \fBXDevice\fP structure that is used
by most other input extension requests to identify the specified device.
For a description of the \fBXOpenDevice\fP request, see the section
entitled "Enabling and Disabling Extension Devices".
.IP \(bu 3n
Determine the event types and event clases needed to select the desired
input extension events, and identify them when they are received.
This is done via macros whose name corresponds to the desired event,
i.e. \fBDeviceKeyPress\fP.  For a description of these macros, see the 
section entitled "Selecting Extension Device Events".
.IP \(bu 3n
XSelectExtensionEvent - select the desired events from the server.
For a description of the \fBXSelextExtensionEvent\fP request, see the 
section entitled "Selecting Extension Device Events".
.IP \(bu 3n
XNextEvent - receive the next available event.  This is the core
\fBXNextEvent\fP function provided by the standard X libarary.
.LP
Other requests are defined to grab and focus extension devices, to
change their key, button, or modifier mappings, to control the
propagation of input extension events, to get motion history from an
extension device, and to send input extension events to another client.
These functions are described in the following sections.
.NH 1
Library Extension Requests
.XS
\*(SN Library Extension Requests
.XE
.LP
Extension input devices are accessed by client programs through the 
use of new protocol requests.
The following requests are provided as extensions to Xlib.  Constants
and structures referenced by these functions may be found in the 
files \fBXI.h\fP and \fBXInput.h\fP, which are attached to this document as 
appendix A.
.LP
The library will return \fBNoSuchExtension\fP if an extension request
is made to a server that does not support the input extension.
.LP
Input extension requests cannot be used to access the X keyboard and
X pointer devices.
.NH 2

.NH 3
Changing The Core Devices
.XS
\*(SN Changing The Core Devices
.XE
.LP
These functions are provided to change which physical device is used
as the X pointer or X keyboard.
.NT
Using these functions may change the characteristics of the core devices.
The new pointer device may have a different number of buttons than the 
old one did, or the new keyboard device may have a different number of
keys or report a different range of keycodes.  Client programs may be
running that depend on those characteristics.  For example, a client
program could allocate an array based on the number of buttons on the
pointer device, and then use the button numbers received in button events
as indicies into that array.  Changing the core devices could cause
such client programs to behave improperly or abnormally terminate,
if they ignore the ChangeDeviceNotify event generated by these requests.
.NE
.LP
These functions change the X keyboard or X pointer device and generate
an \fBXChangeDeviceNotify\fP event and a \fBMappingNotify\fP event.  
The specified device becomes the
new X keyboard or X pointer device.  The location of the core device
does not change as a result of this request.
.LP
These requests fail and return \fBAlreadyGrabbed\fP if either the specified
device or the core device it would replace are grabbed by some other
client.  They fail and return \fBGrabFrozen\fP if either device is frozen
by the active grab of another client.
.LP
These requests fail with a \fBBadDevice\fP error if the specified device is
invalid, has not previously been opened via \fBXOpenDevice\fP, or is
not supported as a core device by the server implementation.
.sp 2
.LP
Once the device has successfully replaced one of the core devices, it
is treated as a core device until it is in turn replaced by another
\fBChangeDevice\fP request, or until the server terminates.  The termination
of the client that changed  the device will not cause it to change back.
Attempts to use the \fBXCloseDevice\fP request to close the new core device will
fail with a \fBBadDevice\fP error.
.LP
To change which physical device is used as the X keyboard, use
the \fBXChangeKeyboardDevice\fP function.
.LP
The specified device must support input class \fBKeys\fP (as reported in the
\fBListInputDevices\fP request) or the request will fail with a 
\fBBadMatch\fP error.

Event Synchronization And Core Grabs
.XS
\*(SN Event Synchronization And Core Grabs
.XE
.LP
Implementation of the input extension requires an extension of the
meaning of event synchronization for the core grab requests.  This is
necessary in order to allow window managers to freeze all input devices
with a single request.
.LP
The core grab requests require a \fBpointer_mode\fP and \fBkeyboard_mode\fP
argument.  The meaning of these modes is changed by the input extension.
For the \fBXGrabPointer\fP and \fBXGrabButton\fP requests, \fBpointer_mode\fP
controls synchronization of the pointer device, and \fBkeyboard_mode\fP
controls the synchronization of all other input devices.  
For the \fBXGrabKeyboard\fP
and \fBXGrabKey\fP requests, \fBpointer_mode\fP controls the synchronization
of all input devices except the X keyboard, while \fBkeyboard_mode\fP controls
the synchronization of the keyboard.  When using one of the core grab
requests, the synchronization of extension devices
is controlled by the mode specified for the device not being grabbed.
.NH 3
Extension Active Grabs
.XS
\*(SN Extension Active Grabs
.XE
.LP
Active grabs of
extension devices are supported via the 
\fBXGrabDevice\fP
function in the same way that core devices are grabbed using
the core \fBXGrabKeyboard\fP function, except that a \fIDevice\fP is passed as
a function parameter.  
The \fBXUngrabDevice\fP function allows a
previous active grab for an extension device to be released.
.LP
Passive grabs of buttons and keys on extension devices are supported
via the \fBXGrabDeviceButton\fP and \fBXGrabDeviceKey\fP functions.
These passive grabs are released via the \fBXUngrabDeviceKey\fP and
\fBXUngrabDeviceButton\fP functions.

has caused a device to freeze.
The function has no effect if the specified time is earlier than the last-grab 
time of the most recent active grab for the client and device, 
or if the specified time is later than the current X server time.
The following describes the processing that occurs depending on what constant
you pass to the event_mode argument:
.IP \(bu 3n \fBAsyncThisDevice\fP
If the specified device is frozen by the client, event processing for that 
continues as usual.  If the device is frozen multiple times  by the client on 
behalf of multiple separate grabs, AsyncThisDevice thaws for all.
AsyncThisDevice has no effect if the specified device is not frozen by the 
client, but the device need not be grabbed by the client.
.IP \(bu 3n \fBSyncThisDevice\fP 
If the specified device is frozen and actively grabbed by the client,
event processing for that device continues normally until the next 
key or button event is reported to the client.
At this time, 
the specified device again appears to freeze.
However, if the reported event causes the grab to be released,
the specified device does not freeze.
SyncThisDevice has no effect if the specified device is not frozen by the client
or is not grabbed by the client.
.IP \(bu 3n \fBReplayThisDevice\fP
If the specified device is actively grabbed by the client and is frozen as the result of
an event having been sent to the client (either from the activation of a 
GrabDeviceButton or from a previous AllowDeviceEvents with mode SyncThisDevice, 
but not from a Grab),
the grab is released and that event is completely reprocessed.
This time, however, the request ignores any passive grabs at or above 
(towards the root) the grab-window of the grab just released.
The request has no effect if the specified device is not grabbed by the client
or if it is not frozen as the result of an event.
.IP \(bu 3n \fBAsyncOtherDevices\fP
If the remaining devices are frozen by the client,
event processing for them continues as usual.
If the other devices are frozen multiple times  by the client on behalf of 
multiple separate grabs,
AsyncOtherDevices ``thaws'' for all.
AsyncOtherDevices has no effect if the devices are not frozen by the client,
but those devices need not be grabbed by the client.
.IP \(bu 3n \fBSyncAll\fP
If all devices are frozen by the client,
event processing (for all devices) continues normally until the next
button or key event is reported
to the client for a grabbed device
at which time the devices again appear to
freeze.  However, if the reported event causes the grab to be released,
then the devices do not freeze (but if any device is still
grabbed, then a subsequent event for it will still cause all devices
to freeze).  
SyncAll has no effect unless all devices
are frozen by the client.  If any device is frozen twice
by the client on behalf of two separate grabs, 
SyncAll "thaws" for both (but a subsequent freeze for SyncAll
will only freeze each device once).
.IP \(bu 3n \fBAsyncAll\fP
If all devices are frozen by the
client, event processing (for all devices) continues normally.
If any device is frozen multiple times by the client on behalf of multiple
separate grabs, AsyncAll "thaws" for all.
If any device is frozen twice by the client on behalf of two separate grabs,
AsyncAll "thaws" for both.
AsyncAll has no effect unless all
devices are frozen by the client.
.LP
AsyncThisDevice, SyncThisDevice, and ReplayThisDevice 
have no effect on the processing of events from the remaining devices.
AsyncOtherDevices
has no effect on the processing of events from the specified device.
When the event_mode is SyncAll or AsyncAll, the 
device parameter is ignored.
.LP
It is possible for several grabs of different devices (by the same 
or different clients) to be active simultaneously.
If a device is frozen on behalf of any grab,
no event processing is performed for the device.
It is possible for a single device to be frozen because of several grabs.
In this case,
the freeze must be released on behalf of each grab before events can 
again be processed.

The acceleration, expressed as a fraction, is a multiplier for movement. 
For example,
specifying 3/1 means the device moves three times as fast as normal.
The fraction may be rounded arbitrarily by the X server.  
Acceleration
only takes effect if the device moves more than threshold pixels at
once and only applies to the amount beyond the value in the threshold argument.
Setting a value to -1 restores the default.
The values of the accelNumerator and threshold fields must be nonzero for
the pointer values to be set.
Otherwise, the parameters will be unchanged.
Negative values generate a \fBBadValue\fP
error, as does a zero value
for the accelDenominator field.

The

an extension device.  If it succeeds, the X server generates a
\fBDeviceMappingNotify\fP event, and \fBXSetDeviceButtonMapping\fP
returns \fBMappingSuccess\fP.
Elements of the list are indexed starting from one.
The length of the list must be the same as
\fBXGetDeviceButtonMapping\fP would return, or a \fBBadValue\fP

The index is a button number, and the element of the list
defines the effective number.
A zero element disables a button, and elements are not restricted in
value by the number of physical buttons.
However, no two elements can have the same nonzero value,
or a \fBBadValue\fP error results.
If any of the buttons to be altered are logically in the down state,
\fBXSetDeviceButtonMapping\fP returns \fBMappingBusy\fP,

\*(SN Event Types
.XE
.LP
Event types are integer numbers that a client can use to determine what
kind of event it has received.  The client compares the type field of 
the event structure with known event types to make this determination.
.LP
The core input event types are constants and are defined in the header
file \fB<X11/X.h>\fP.  Extension event types are not constants.  Instead, they
are dynamically allocated by the extension's request to the X server
when the extension is initialized.  Because of this, extension event
types must be obtained by the client from the server.
.LP
The client program determines the event type for an extension event by using
the information returned by the \fBXOpenDevice\fP request.
This type can then be used for comparison with the type field
of events received by the client.
.LP
Extension events propagate up the window hierarchy in the same manner
as core events.  If a window is not interested in an extension event, 
it usually propagates to the closest ancestor that is interested,
unless the dont_propagate list prohibits it.
Grabs of extension devices may alter the set of windows that receive a particular
extension event.

Event classes are integer numbers that are used in the same way as the
core event masks.  They are used by a client program to indicate to the
server which events that client program wishes to receive.
.LP
The core input event masks are constants and are defined in the header
file \fB<X11/X.h>\fP.  Extension event classes are not constants.  Instead, 
they are dynamically allocated by the extension's request to the X server
when the extension is initialized.  Because of this, extension event
classes must be obtained by the client from the server.
.LP
The event class for an extension event and device is obtained from
information returned by the 
\fBXOpenDevice\fP function. 
This class can then be used in an \fBXSelectExtensionEvent\fP
request to ask that events of that type from that device be sent to
the client program.
.LP
For \fBDeviceButtonPress\fP events, the client may specify whether
or not an implicit passive grab should be done when the button is
pressed.  If the client wants to guarantee that it will receive
a \fBDeviceButtonRelease\fP event for each \fBDeviceButtonPress\fP
event it receives, it should specify the  \fBDeviceButtonPressGrab\fP
class in addition to the \fBDeviceButtonPress\fP class.
This restricts the client in that only one client at a time
may request \fBDeviceButtonPress\fP events from the same device and
window if any client specifies this class.
.LP
If any client has specified the \fBDeviceButtonPressGrab\fP class, any requests
by any other client that specify the same device and window and specify
either \fBDeviceButtonPress\fP or \fBDeviceButtonPressGrab\fP will
cause an \fBAccess\fP error to be generated.
.LP
If only the \fBDeviceButtonPress\fP class is specified, no implicit
passive grab will be done when a button is pressed on the device.
Multiple clients may use this class to specify the same device and
window combination.
.LP
The client may also select \fBDeviceMotion\fP events only when a 
button is down.  It does this by specifying the event classes 
\fBDeviceButton1Motion\fP through \fBDeviceButton5Motion\fP.  
An input device will only support
as many button motion classes as it has buttons.

This function returns pointers to two event class arrays.  
One lists the extension events selected by this client from
the specified window.  The other lists the extension events selected by
all clients from the specified window.  This information is analogous

Extension events propagate up the window hierarchy in the same manner
as core events.  If a window is not interested in an extension event, 
it usually propagates to the closest ancestor that is interested,
unless the dont_propagate list prohibits it.
Grabs of extension devices may alter the set of windows that receive a 
particular extension event.
.LP
Client programs may control event propagation through the use
of the following two functions.  
.LP
\fBXChangeDeviceDontPropagateList\fP adds an event to or deletes an event from 
the do_not_propagate list of extension events for the specified window.
There is one list per window, and the list remains for the life of the window.
The list is not altered if a client that changed the list terminates.
.LP
Suppression of event propagation is not allowed for all events.  If a
specified XEventClass is invalid because suppression of that event is not
allowed, a \fBBadClass\fP error will result.

The XSendExtensionEvent function identifies the destination window,
determines which clients should receive the specified event, and ignores
any active grabs.  This function requires a list of XEventClasses to be
specified.  These are obtained by opening an input device with the
XOpenDevice request.
.LP
This function uses the \fBwindow\fP argument to identify the destination
window as follows:
.IP \(bu 3n
If you pass \fBPointerWindow\fP, the destination window is the window
that contains the pointer.
.IP \(bu 3n
If you pass \fBInputFocus\fP, and if the focus window contains the pointer,
the destination window is the window that contains the pointer.  If the 
focus window does not contain the pointer, the destination window is the 
focus window.
.LP
To determine which clients should receive the specified events, 
\fBXSendExtensionEvent\fP uses the propagate argument as follows:
.IP \(bu 3n
If propagate is \fBFalse\fP, the event is sent to every client selecting
from the destination window
any of the events specified in the event_list array.
.IP \(bu 3n
If propagate is \fBTrue\fP, and no clients have selected
from the destination window
any of the events specified in the event_list array, the destination is 
replaced with the closest ancestor of destination for which some client
has selected one of the specified events, and for which no intervening
window has that event in its do_not_propagate mask.  If no such window
exists, or if the window is an ancestor of the focus window, and 
\fBInputFocus\fP was originally specified as the destination, the event
is not sent to any clients.  Otherwise, the event is reported to every
client selecting on the final destination any of the events specified
in event_list.
.LP
The event in the \fBXEvent\fP structure must be one of the events defined
by the input extension, so that the X server can correctly byte swap the
contents as necessary.  The contents of the event are otherwise unaltered
and unchecked by the X server except to force send_event to \fBTrue\fP
in the forwarded event and to set the sequence number in the event correctly.
.LP
XSendExtensionEvent returns zero if the conversion-to-wire protocol
failed, otherwise it returns nonzero.

This function can generate \fBBadDevice\fP, \fBBadValue\fP, \fBBadWindow\fP,

The data field of the \fBXDeviceTimeCoord\fP structure is a pointer to an 
array of data items.  Each item is of type int, and there is one data item
per axis of motion reported by the device.  The number of axes reported
by the device is returned in the axis_count variable.
.LP
The value of the data items depends on the mode of the device. 
The mode is returned in the mode variable.  If the 
mode is \fBAbsolute\fP, the data items are the raw values generated by
the device.  These may be scaled by the client program using the
maximum values that the device can generate for each axis of motion
that it reports.  The maximum value for each axis is reported in
the max_val field of the \fBXAxisInfo\fP structure.  This structure is 
part of the information returned by the \fBXListInputDevices\fP request.
.LP
If the mode is \fBRelative\fP, the data items are the relative values
generated by the device.  The client program must choose an initial
position for the device and maintain a current position by 
accumulating these relative values.

Consecutive calls to this function may return data of different modes, if
some client program has changed the mode of the device via an
