<F5>Introduction<Tab><F6>16.1<F0><#04>CLX error conditions are 
hierarchial. The base error condition is<FJ>
<F6>x<#1e>error<F0>, and all other conditions are built on top of <F6>x<#1e>
error<F0>. <F6>x<#1e>error<F0> can be built on a lower<#1e>level 
condition that is implementation dependent (this is probably the <F6>error
<F0> condition).

<F2>Macro

<para>

Any new condition type must be defined with the <F6>define<#1e>condition<F0> 
macro. A condition type has a name, parent types, report message, 
and any number of slot items. See the <F7>Lisp Reference<F0> manual 
for further information regarding <F6>define<#1e>condition<F0>.

The following are the predefined error conditions that can occur in 
CLX.
