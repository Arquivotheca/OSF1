<F7>Extensions<Tab><F8>15.1<F0><#04>The X Window System is based 
on a core protocol which can be extended to<SP>provide new functionality.  
An extension is generally represented by an<SP>additional set of requests 
or event types that are implemented by an X<SP>server supporting the 
extension. By definition, a client program using an<SP>extension may 
not be portable to other servers. However, extensions allow<SP>different 
server implementations and different sites to add their own<SP>special 
features to X, without disrupting clients that rely only on the<SP>core 
protocol.

<para>

Extensions are identified by assigning them unique name strings and 
major<SP>protocol numbers. A client program can request an X server 
to use a<SP>protocol extension by furnishing the extension protocol 
number<FJ>
as an<SP>argument to <F8>open<#1e>display<F0>. The X Consortium 
maintains a registry of<SP>standard extension names and protocol numbers.

The following paragraphs describe the CLX functions used to:
