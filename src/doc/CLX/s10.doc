<F8>Introduction<Tab><F7>10.1<#04><F0>A <F2>cursor<F0> is a visible 
shape that appears at the current position of<SP>the pointer device. 
The cursor shape moves with the pointer to provide<SP>continuous feedback 
to the user about the current location of the pointer.<SP>Each window 
can have a cursor attribute that defines the appearance of the<SP>pointer 
cursor when the pointer position lies within the window. See <F7>window<#1e>cu
rsor<F0>.

<para>

A cursor image is composed of a source bitmap, a mask bitmap, a <F2>hot 
spot<F0>, a foreground color, and a background color. Either 1<#1e>bit 
pixmaps or<SP>font glyphs can be used to specify source and mask bitmaps. 
The source<SP>bitmap identifies the foreground and background pixels 
of the cursor image;<SP>the mask bitmap identifies which source pixels 
are actually drawn. The mask<SP>bitmap thus allows a cursor to assume 
any shape. The hot spot defines the<SP>position within the cursor 
image that is displayed at the pointer position.

In CLX, a cursor is represented by a <F7>cursor<F0> object. This 
section describes<SP>the CLX functions to:

 cursor <#1f> <F3>Type <F0>cursor<F3>.

<para>

Creates and returns a cursor. <F7>:x<F0> and <F7>:y<F0> define 
the position of the hot spot relative to the origin of the <F7>:source. 
:foreground<F0> and <F7>:background<F0> colors must be<SP>specified, 
even if the server only has a <F7>:static<#1e>gray<F0> or <F7>:gray<#1e>scal
e<F0> screen.<SP>The <F7>:source<F0>, <F7>:x<F0>, and <F7>:y<F0><SP>argu
ments must also be specified.

The cursor image is drawn by drawing a pixel from the <F7>:source<F0> 
bitmap at<SP>every position where the corresponding bit in the <F7>:mask<F0> 
bitmap is 1. If the<SP>corresponding <F7>:source<F0> bit is 1, a 
pixel is drawn in the <F7>:foreground<F0><SP>color; otherwise, a 
pixel is drawn in the <F7>:background<F0> color. If the <F7>:mask<F0> 
is<SP>omitted, all <F7>:source<F0> pixels are drawn. If given, the <F7>:mask
<F0> must be the same size as the <F7>:source<F0>.

An X server may not be able to support every cursor size. A server 
is free to modify any component of the cursor to satisfy hardware 
or software limitations.

The <F7>:source<F0> and <F7>:mask<F0> can be freed immediately 
after the cursor is created. Subsequent drawing in the <F7>:source<F0> 
or<SP><F7>:mask<F0> pixmap has an undefined effect on the cursor.

<arg>

<F7>:source<F3> <#1f> The source pixmap. This argument is required.

<|,"10<#1e>108"><F7>:mask<F3> <#1f> The mask pixmap.

Creates and returns a cursor defined by font glyphs. The source bitmap

The mask bitmap is defined by<SP>the <F7>:mask<#1e>font<F0> and <F7>:mask<#1e>
char<F0>. It is an error if the <F7>:source<#1e>char<F0> and<SP><F7>:mask<#1e>
char<F0> are not valid indexes for the <F7>:source<#1e>font<F0> 
and <F7>:mask<#1e>font<F0>,<SP>respectively. The hot spot position 
is defined by the <#7f>character origin" of<SP> the source glyph, 
that is, the position [- <F2>char<#1e>left<#1e>bearing<F0>, <F2>char<#1e>asc
ent<F0>]<SP>relative to the upper left corner of the source glyph 
bitmap.

Source and mask bits are compared after aligning the character origins 
of<SP>the source and mask glyphs. The source and mask glyphs need 
not have the<SP>same size or character origin position. If the <F7>:mask<#1e>f
ont<F0> is<SP>omitted, all source pixels are drawn.

An X server may not be able to support every cursor size. A server 
is free<SP>to modify any component of the cursor to satisfy hardware 
or software limitations.

Either of the <F7>:source<#1e>font<F0> or <F7>:mask<#1e>font<F0> 
can be closed after the cursor is<SP>created.

<arg>

<F7>:source<#1e>font<F3> <#1f> The source font. This is a required 
argument.

<F7>:mask<#1e>char<F3> <#1f> An index specifying a glyph in the
