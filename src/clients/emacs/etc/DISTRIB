	   GNU Emacs availability information, January 1992
Copyright (C) 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

	Permission is granted to anyone to make or distribute
	verbatim copies of this document provided that the
	copyright notice and this permission notice are preserved.

GNU Emacs is legally owned by the Free Software Foundation, but we
regard the foundation actually as its custodian on behalf of the
public, since all software ought to be the common property of mankind.

The foundation permits everyone to have and run copies of GNU Emacs,
at no charge, and to redistribute copies under certain conditions
which are designed to make sure that that all modified versions of GNU
Emacs remain as free as the versions we distribute.  These conditions
are stated in the document "GNU Emacs General Public License," a copy
of which is required to be distributed with every copy of GNU Emacs.
It is usually in a file named COPYING in the same directory as this
file.

If you do not know anyone to get a copy of GNU Emacs from, you can
order a tape from the Free Software Foundation.	 We distribute Emacs
version 18 on mag tape in different formats for many machines.	We also
distribute nicely typeset copies of the Emacs user manual, Emacs Lisp
Reference Manual, the Emacs reference card, etc.  See the order form at
the end of this file.

If you have Internet access, you can copy the latest Emacs
distribution from host prep.ai.mit.edu.	 There are several ways to do
this; see the file `FTP' in the same directory as this file for more
information.  Even better, get the latest version of the file from
`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP' on prep.ai.mit.edu for the most current
arrangements.  It may also be possible to copy Emacs via uucp; the
file `FTP' contains information on that too.

Emacs has been run on both Berkeley Unix and System V Unix, on a
variety of types of cpu.  It also works on VMS and on Apollo
computers, though with some deficiencies that reflect problems in
these operating systems.  See the file MACHINES in this directory for
a full list of machines that GNU Emacs has been tested on, with
machine-specific installation notes and warnings.

Note that there is significant variation between Unix systems
supposedly running the same version of Unix; it is possible that what
works in GNU Emacs for me does not work on your system due to such an
incompatibility.  Since I must avoid reading Unix source code, I
cannot even guess what such problems may exist.

GNU Emacs is distributed with no warranty (see the General Public
License for full details, in the file COPYING in this directory), and
neither I nor the Free Software Foundation promises any kind of
support or assistance to users.	 The foundation keeps a list of people
who are willing to offer support and assistance for hire.  It is
usually in a file named SERVICE in the same directory as this file.
You get the latest version of the file from `/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/SERVICE' on
prep.ai.mit.edu.

However, we plan to continue to improve GNU Emacs and keep it
reliable, so please send me any complaints and suggestions you have.
I will probably fix anything that I consider a malfunction.  I may
make improvements that are suggested, but I may choose not to.
Improving Emacs is not my highest priority now.

If you are on the Internet, report bugs to
bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu; on UUCP, use the address
...!uunet!prep.ai.mit.edu!bug-gnu-emacs.  Otherwise, phone the
foundation at the number listed below, or write to the address listed
below.	General questions about the GNU Project can be asked of
gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu.

If you are a computer manufacturer, I encourage you to ship a copy of
GNU Emacs with every computer you deliver.  The same copying
permission terms apply to computer manufacturers as to everyone else.
You should consider making a donation to help support the GNU project;
if you estimate what it would cost to distribute some commercial
product and divide it by five, that is a good amount.

If you like GNU Emacs, please express your satisfaction with a
donation: send me or the Foundation what you feel Emacs has been worth
to you.	 If you are glad that I developed GNU Emacs and distribute it
as freeware, rather than following the obstructive and antisocial
practices typical of software developers, reward me.  If you would
like the Foundation to develop more free software, contribute.

Your donations will help to support the development of more useful
software to be distributed on the same basis as GNU Emacs.  Eventually
we will have a complete imitation of the Unix operating system, called
GNU (Gnu's Not Unix), which will run Unix user programs.  For more
information on GNU, see the file GNU in this directory.
