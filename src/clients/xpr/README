* HISTORY
*

This directory contains a modified version of the program `xpr'
from the Version 10 Release 3 distribution of X to allow it to drive a
PostScript device (such as the Apple LaserWriter).
See documentation, include files, make files, etc. in the original
X distribution for more information.
See the comment at the head of xpr.c for details about how it differs
from the distributed version.

	This directory was moved from orpheus:/u1/X/NRFPT/xpr to 
orpheus:/u1/X11/clients/xpr_lw on 6-4-87 for use as the foundation of
X11 xpr and xdpr.  The files in this directory are modified versions of
the origionals, for use with X11.

is now the standard xpr (etc) for X11.
