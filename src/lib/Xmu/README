* HISTORY
*
This library contains miscellaneous utilities and is not part of the Xlib
standard.  It contains routines which only use public interfaces so that it
may be layered on top of any proprietary implementation of Xlib or Xt.

It is intended to support clients in the MIT distribution; vendors
may choose not to distribute this library if they wish.  Therefore,
applications developers who depend on this library should be prepared to
treat it as part of their software base when porting.
