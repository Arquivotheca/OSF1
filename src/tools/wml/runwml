# HISTORY
# 
#
# Read the wml input. Create most UIL...h and the various .dat files
#
wml motif-tables.wml

#
# read grammar.dat and grammar.y and assemble Uil.y
# the invariant stuff is in grammar.y and the class names are in 
# grammar.dat
#
wmluily < grammar.dat > Uil.y

#
# now scan Uil.y for all the tokens, built-in plus class names, and
# assemble the whole set of tokens.
#
wmltokens < Uil.y > tokens.dat

#
# now build UilKeyDef.h, UilKeyTab.h, and UilTokName.h from the
# grammar and the individual token class data
#
wmlkeyword < tokens.dat 

#
# build parser, and move all files to the source directory
#
yacc Uil.y
mv y.tab.c ../uilsrc/UilLexPars.c
mv Uil*.h ../uilsrc/.
