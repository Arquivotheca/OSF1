/*   Name:	msi_init_pb	- Initialize a Path Block

 *
 *		NOTE: This is an optional PD function( Init_pb ) for use by the
 *		      CI PPD finite state machine.  The MSI port driver
 *		      provides it because the driver has MSI port specific
 *		      information to store and because remote MSI ports may be
 *		      in states unsuitable for path establishment.  Other port
 *		      drivers do not have such needs and need not provide this
 *		      function.  Those port drivers which do provide this
 *		      function and allow it to return failure status must log
 *		      the failure reason in a PD specific fashion.  However,
 *		      only the very first occurrence of failure on each path

/*   Name:	msi_send_reqid	- Request Remote Port Identification
 *
 *   Abstract:	This function initiates a request for the identification of a
 *		specific remote port.  It is provided by the port driver for
 *		use by the CI PPD finite state machine during port polling for
 *		the maintenance of existing paths and the initiation of new
 *		ones.
 *
 *		Execution of this function may also result in asynchronous
 *		reception of information corresponding to the report port whose
 *		identification was requested.  Such reception through
 *		invocation of cippd_receive() occurs only when a request is
 *		made for an existing remote port.
 *
 *		Initiating a request for remote port identification is
 *		accomplished by initiating transmission of a MSI port specific
 *		IDREQ packet to the target remote port.  Either a MSI port
 *		command packet or a MSI port specific datagram buffer may be
 *		used to contain the identification request.  Datagram buffers
 *		are used only when explicitly supplied to the function and are
 *		disposed of following packet transmission as specified.
 *		Command packets are allocated by this function when datagram
 *		buffers are not provided.  They are always deallocated
 *		following packet transmission.
 *
 *		NOTE: This is a mandatory PD function( Send_Reqid ) for use by
 *		      the CI PPD finite state machine.  Not all port drivers
 *		      issue port commands in order to obtain remote port
 *		      identifications like the MSI port driver.  However, all
 *		      drivers must still supply this function for scheduling
 *		      purposes.  All port drivers must schedule CI PPD
 *		      reception of remote port identification information.
 *		      Those drivers, unlike the MSI port driver, which have NOT
 *		      permanently disabled sanity checking on their local ports
 *		      must also schedule CI PPD notification of the completion
 *		      of their requests for remote port identifications.  Such
 *		      notifications occur through invocation of
 *		      cippd_reqid_snt(), but only when the caller requests
 *		      deallocation of the packet used in satisfying the request
 *		      ( dispose == DEALLOC_BUF ).  How each driver goes about
 *		      performing each scheduling is driver specific, but all
 *		      notifications MUST be done asynchronously.  They may NOT
 *		      occur through immediate call backs.  All drivers must
 *		      also dispose of all port specific datagram buffers
 *		      optionally provided to this function as specified.
 *		      
 *		NOTE: SCA port numbers are 6 bytes in size; however, maximum
 *		      MSI and CI PPD port numbers only occupy 1 byte, the
 *		      low-order byte of a port station address.  Port numbers
 *		      are passed as 4 bytes entities back and forth between the
 *		      CI PPD and MSI port driver.
 *
 *		NOTE: The requested identification information must always be
 *		      passed back to the CI PPD within a port specific datagram
 *		      buffer whenever the requested remote port is found to
 *		      exist.  The contents of this information is however
 *		      driver specific.  It is passed by the CI PPD to the
 *		      driver's optionally provided Init_pb routine during path
 *		      establishment, presumably for storage in the PB
 *		      corresponding to the new path being established.
 *
 *		NOTE: All attempts to transmit packets to the local ports own
 *		      station address are bypassed.  The SII chip is not
 *		      capable of either internal loopback or simultaneous
 *		      transmission and reception; and, no need exists to
 *		      provide this function in software.
 *
 *   Inputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   cippdbp			- Address of CI PPD header in datagram buffer
 *   dispose			- RECEIVE_BUF or DEALLOC_BUF
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer

    /* Only the Transmit Fork Process( XFP ) interfaces directly with the SII
     * chip for the purpose of processing outgoing MSI packets.  All other
     * driver routines must interface with the XFP.  Therefore, the steps
     * involved in requesting transmission of a remote port identification
     * request are as follows:
     *
     * 1. Verify the target port station address.
     * 2. Allocate a MSI port command packet if a MSI port specific datagram
     *	  buffer was not explicitly provided.
     * 3. Format the MSIB buffer.
     * 4. Insert the MSIB buffer onto the appropriate command queue.
     * 5. Request the XFP to process outgoing MSI packets.
     *
     * Requests for identification of the local ports own station address are
     * always satisfied without transmitting an IDREQ packet( Step 1 ).  All
     * MSI port specific datagram buffers provided are immediately disposed of
     * as directed.  Furthermore, the CI PPD is purposely never asynchronously
     * notified of the existence of the local port.
     *
     * Formatting the MSIB buffer( Step 3 ) consists of formatting the:
     *
     * MSIB buffer header - information needed by XFP for packet transmission
     * MSI port header    - common MSI packet fields
     * MSI packet body	  - IDREQ specific MSI packet fields
     *
     * IDREQ specific MSI packet fields requiring formatting by this routine
     * include only the transaction identifier.  This field is currently always
     * set to 0.
     *
     * MSIB buffers containing identification requests are always inserted onto
     * the appropriate low priority command queue( Step 4 ).  The PCCB specific
     * COMQL is locked immediately prior to insertion and unlocked immediately
     * afterwards.  This guarantees exclusive access to the queue.
     *
     * The XFP is requested to begin processing of outgoing MSI packets( Step
     * 5 ) by scheduling its asynchronous execution.  This step is bypassed
     * whenever XFP execution has already been scheduled but has not yet
     * commenced.  During XFP scheduling the PCCB is locked( EXTERNALLY ) to
     * guarantee the existence of only 1 scheduled asynchronous XFP thread at
     * any given moment.
     *
     * NOTE:	It is possible for a XFP thread to be currently active.  This
     *		does not prevent scheduling of asynchronous XFP execution.
     *		However, the new thread does not begin to process outgoing MSI
     *		packets until the currently active thread completes.  Also, no
     *		other additional XFP threads are scheduled until the new thread
     *		begins processing outgoing MSI packets.
     *
     * NOTE:	Existence of the targeted remote port results in automatic
     *		remote initiated transmission of its identification.  Reception
     *		of this information automatically triggers asynchronous CI PPD
     *		notification of identification reception.
