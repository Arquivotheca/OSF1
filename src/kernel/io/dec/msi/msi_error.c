/*   Name:	msi_clean_port	- Clean up Local MSI Port
 *
 *   Abstract:	This routine directs the second stage of local MSI port clean
 *		up.  It is always invoked by forking to it.
 *
 *		Failed local MSI ports are cleaned up in two stages.  The first
 *		stage consists of those actions which should be performed
 *		immediately following port disablement and are insensitive to
 *		processor state.  The second stage consists of those activities
 *		which need not be performed immediately following port
 *		disablement and should be executed within a constant
 *		well-defined processor state.  This routine direct this second
 *		stage of port clean up and the constant environment necessary
 *		for its proper execution is provided by always forking to it.
 *
 *   Inputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *	lpinfo.reason		-  Reason for port failure
 *	ppd.cippd		-  CI PPD specific PCCB fields
 *	    fsmstatus.cleanup	-   1
 *	    fsmstatus.fkip	-   1
 *	    fsmstatus.online	-   0
 *
 *   Outputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *	ppd.cippd		-  CI PPD specific PCCB fields
 *	    fsmstatus.fkip	-   0
 *
 *   SMP:	The PCCB is locked to synchronize access.  PCCB locking is
 *		probably unnecessary because of lack of conflict for the PCCB
 *		due to single threading of port clean up and re-initialization.
 *		It is done anyway to guarantee unrestricted access and because
 *		the CI PPD interval timer may still be active.  PCCB addresses
 *		are always valid because these data structures are never
 *		deleted once their corresponding ports have been initialized.

/*   Name:	msi_console_log	- Log MSI Events to Console Terminal
 *
 *   Abstract:	This routine logs MSI events to the console terminal.  The
 *		event is always one of the following types:
 *
 *		PATH_EVENT	- Path specific event
 *		RPORT_EVENT	- Remote port specific event
 *		LPORT_EVENT	- Local port specific event
 *
 *		Explicit formatting information must be provided for each
 *		event.  This requires updating of the following tables each
 *		time a new event is defined:
 *
 *		1. The appropriate entry within the MSI console logging table(
 *		   msi_cltab[][] ) must be updated to reflect the new maximum
 *		   code represented within the associated format table.
 *
 *		2. The associated format table itself( msi_cli[], msi_clw[],
 *		   msi_clre[], msi_cle[], msi_clse[], msi_clfe[],
 *		   msi_clppdse[] ) must be updated with both the class of
 *		   variable information and exact text to be displayed.
 *		   However, the appropriate table should be updated with a NULL
 *		   entry whenever the MSI port driver is specifically NOT to
 *		   log a new event.  This applies only to msi_clppdse[] when a
 *		   new CI PPD severe error event is to be specifically logged
 *		   only by the CI PPD and not by appropriate port drivers such
 *		   as the MSI port driver.
 *
 *		NOTE: Console logging of events is bypassed whenever the event
 *		      severity does not warrant console logging according to
 *		      the current MSI severity level( msi_severity ).  Such
 *		      bypassing is overridden when the ECLAWAYS bit is set in
 *		      the event code indicating that the event is always to be
 *		      logged regardless of the current severity level.
 *
 *		NOTE: This routine does NOT log events arising external to the
 *		      MSI port driver with the exception of those CI PPD severe
 *		      error events which are candidates for application of the
 *		      local port crash severity modifier( ESM_LPC ).
 *
 *   Inputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   msi_cltab			- MSI console logging table
 *   msi_severity		- MSI console logging severity level
 *   msicmdblkp			- Address of MSI command block( OPTIONAL )
 *   msipp			- Address of MSI packet( OPTIONAL )
 *   event			- Event code
 *   event_type			- PATH_EVENT, LPORT_EVENT, RPORT_EVENT
 *   pb				- Path Block pointer( OPTIONAL )
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *	pd.msi			-  MSI specific PCCB fields
 *	    errlogopt.portnum	-   Remote port station address

/*   Name:	msi_log_initerr	- Log MSI Port Initialization Fatal Errors
 *
 *   Abstract:	This routine logs a special type of MSI device attention event:
 *		software errors detected during probing of local MSI ports.
 *		These fatal error events are logged as device attentions
 *		because they pertain to a specific local MSI port.  However,
 *		they are considered special because they pre-date allocation of
 *		a PCCB for the local port, and therefore, may not make use of
 *		it for event logging purposes.  The following special events
 *		are currently defined:
 *
 *		1. FE_INIT_ZEROID  - Uninitialized system identification num
 *		2. FE_INIT_NOMEM   - Insufficient dynamic memory
 *		3. FE_INIT_NOPTES  - Insufficient ptes for double mapping
 *
 *		All such events represent fatal errors.  None ever have the
 *		local port crash severity modified( ESM_LPC ) applied.
 *
 *		The occurrence of an port initialization fatal event is also
 *		automatically logged to the console, but without variable
 *		information.
 *
 *		Explicit formatting information must be provided for each
 *		event.  This requires updating of the following tables each
 *		time a new MSI fatal error event is defined:
 *
 *		1. The MSI fatal error event table( msi_clfe[]) must be updated
 *		   with the exact text to be displayed and the console logging
 *		   format code CF_NONE( Console logged MSI fatal error events
 *		   currently never display variable information ).
 *
 *		2. The fatal error event entry within the MSI console logging
 *		   table( msi_cltab[][] ) must be updated to reflect the new
 *		   maximum fatal error event code.
 *
 *   Inputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   hpt			- Hardware port type
 *   msi_cltab			- MSI console logging table
 *   msinum			- MSI adapter number
 *   event			- Fatal error event code
 *   scs_node_name		- SCS node name
 *   scs_system_id		- SCS system identification number
 *
 *   Outputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *
 *   SMP:	No locks are required.

/*   Name:	msi_log_packet	- Log MSI Packet Related Events
 *
 *   Abstract:	This routine logs MSI packet related events.  Such events are
 *		ascertained indirectly from a MSI port packet as opposed to
 *		those events detected directly from a specific local MSI port.
 *		The event is also optionally logged to the console.
 *
 *		Five classes of events are currently logged by this routine:
 *
 *		1. Software detected errors during packet reception.
 *		2. Software detected invalid remote port states.
 *		3. Software detected errors during packet transmission. 
 *		4. Software detected invalid MSI remote port station addresses.
 *		5. Reception of packets over software non-existent paths.
 *
 *		Many of these events represent serious errors and are logged to
 *		save relevant information before drastic steps are attempted to
 *		resolve them.  Others are less serious and are logged only to
 *		give a warning or for informational purposes only.
 *
 *		NOTE: While all events logged therein arise indirectly from MSI
 *		      port packets, the logging of each event does not
 *		      necessarily involve logging of the packet itself.
 *
 *		NOTE: This routine does NOT log events arising external to the
 *		      MSI port driver with the exception of those CI PPD events
 *		      which are candidates for application of the local port
 *		      crash severity modifier( ESM_LPC ).
 *
 *   Inputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   event			- Event code
 *   event_type			- PATH_EVENT, LPORT_EVENT, RPORT_EVENT
 *   lscs			- Local system permanent information
 *   msicmdblkp			- Address of MSI command block( OPTIONAL )
 *   msipp			- Address of MSI packet( OPTIONAL )
 *   pb				- Path Block pointer( OPTIONAL )
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *	pd.msi			-  MSI specific PCCB fields
 *	    errlogopt.portnum	-   Remote port station address
 *				     ( required ONLY when PB not provided )
 *   pktsize			- Size of MSI packet( OPTIONAL )
 *
 *   Outputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *	lpinfo.nerrs		-  Number of errors on port
 *
 *   SMP:	The PCCB is locked( EXTERNALLY ) to synchronize access, to
 *		prevent premature PB deletion when a PB is provided, and as
 *		required by msi_console_log(), the routine responsible for
 *		logging events to the console terminal.
 *
 *		PBs do NOT require locking when provided because only static
 *		fields are accessed.  SBs NEVER require locking.

     *	  record.
     * 4. Allocating an event log record and initializing the record's sub id
     *	  packet fields.
     * 5. Initializing the portion of the record common to all MSI events.
     * 6. Initializing the portion of the record common to all MSI packet
     *	  related events.
     * 7. Moving any optional logged packet information into the record.  
     * 8. Validating the event log record.
     *
     * The ability of this routine to log the event is validated during console
     * logging( Step 1 ).  A panic occurs whenever the MSI port driver is not
     * prepared to log the reported event.
     *
     * Not all events increment the counter of errors which have occurred on
     * the specified local port( Step 2 ).  Only those events with severity
     * level equal to or greater than error( ES_E ) increment the counter.
     *
     * This routine immediately terminates on failure to allocate an event log
     * record( Step 4 ).
     *
     * The size of the application portion of each event log record( Step 3 )
     * is dependent upon the presence or absence of optional information to be
     * included within the record( Step 7 ).  The following types of orthogonal
     * optional information may be logged:
     *
     * 1. The MSI port packet responsible for the logged packet related event.
     * 2. The MSI command block associated with the responsible port packet.
     *
     * Sufficient space is reserved within the event record for such optional
     * information only for those events which request their logging.  The
     * optional MSI port packets are associated with many different events and
     * vary widely in size.  Such packets require truncation whenever logging
     * their full size would exceed the maximum size of an event log record.
     *
     * NOTE: An event may request logging of both a MSI port packet and an
     *	     associated command block, just a MSI port packet, or neither.  No
     *	     event currently ever requests logging of a MSI command block
     *	     without also requesting logging of a MSI port packet.
