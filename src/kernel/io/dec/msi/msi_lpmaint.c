/*   Name:	msi_crash_lport	- Crash MSI Local Port
 *
 *   Abstract:	This routine crashes a specific local MSI port and initiates
 *		the process by which it is disabled, cleaned up, and
 *		re-initialized.  It may be sequentially invoked any number of
 *		times to crash a specific port; however, only its first
 *		invocation actually results in crashing of the port.  All
 *		subsequent invocations only log crash requests.  This situation
 *		persists until after the next incarnation of the port begins
 *		following completion of port clean up and re-initialization.
 *
 *		NOTE: This routine may NEVER be invoked with the address of the
 *		      SCS header in an optional MSIB buffer.  The CI PPD
 *		      currently never makes use of this routine parameter and
 *		      the MSI port driver caches the address, size, and remote
 *		      port station address of any optional MSI packet it wishes
 *		      logged.
 *
 *		NOTE: All error recovery is bypassed in favor of immediately
 *		      panicing the system whenever the MSI configuration
 *		      variable flag msi_lpc_panic is set.  Normally, this flag
 *		      is 0 and error recovery is the default action taken.  It
 *		      is set only when special debugging activity is required.
 *
 *		NOTE: The MSI port driver NEVER requires sanity checks to be
 *		      made on its local ports.  It always initializes the PCCB
 *		      specific finite state machine status bit "nosanity_chk"
 *		      so that the CI PPD skips such checks.  Therefore, the CI
 *		      PPD must NEVER to invoke this routine to crash a local
 *		      MSI port because of a failed sanity check( reason ==
 *		      SE_PPDSANITY ).
 *
 *   Inputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   msi_lpc_panic		- MSI local port crash panic flag
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *	pd.msi			-  MSI specific PCCB fields
 *	    lpcinfo		-   Optional local port crash information
 *		pkth		-    Address of MSI packet
 *		pktsize		-    Size of msi packet
 *		pport_addr	-    Packet remote port station address
 *	    lpstatus.optlpcinfo -   Optional local port crash information flag
 *	    save_dssr		-   Cached DSSI status register contents
 *	    save_dstat		-   Cached data transfer status reg contents
 *   reason			- Reason for crashing local MSI port
 *   scsbp			- NULL !!!!
 *
 *   Outputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *	forkb			-  PCCB fork block
 *	lpinfo.reason		-  Reason for port failure
 *	pd.msi			-  MSI specific PCCB fields
 *	    errlogopt.portnum	-   Remote port station address
 *	ppd.cippd		-  CI PPD specific PCCB fields
 *	    fsmstatus.cleanup	-   1
 *	    fsmstatus.fkip	-   1
 *	    fsmstatus.online	-   0
 *
 *   SMP:	The PCCB is locked INTERNALLY whenever it was not locked
 *		EXTERNALLY prior to routine invocation.  Locking the PCCB
 *		allows exclusive access to PCCB contents, prevents PB deletion,
 *		and is required by both msi_log_packet() and msi_log_devattn(),
 *		the routines responsible for logging local port crash requests.
 *		PCCB addresses are always valid because these data structures
 *		are never deleted once their corresponding ports have been
 *		initialized.
 *
 *   		The PCCB specific XFP and RFP are locked INTERNALLY whenever
 *		they were not locked EXTERNALLY prior to routine invocation.
 *		Their locking is required by msi_disable(), the routine
 *		responsible for disabling the local MSI port.
 *
 *		The PCCB specific XFP and RFP are not only locked but the
 *		respective fork processes are synchronized to as well.  This
 *		synchronization is necessary because occassions exist when
 *		active fork processes must protect against crashing of the
 *		local port while temporarily releasing their locks.
 *		Synchronization to the fork processes by means of their
 *		in-progress SIIBUF pointers is the mechanism chosen to provide
 *		this protection.

    /* Crashing a local MSI port consists of a number of distinct steps:
     *
     * 1. The crash request is pre-processed.
     * 2. The local port is disabled.
     * 3. The local port is cleaned up.
     * 4. The local port is re-initialized.
     *
     * The first step is executed each time this routine is invoked.  It is the
     * latter three steps which constitute crashing the port and are executed
     * only once per port incarnation.  The major benefits of this single 
     * threading of port crashing are the assumptions made during port clean up
     * and re-initialization which follow directly from it.  These assumptions
     * greatly reduce code complexity and allow extension of the MSI port
     * driver to an SMP environment with a minimum of pain.  They are pointed
     * out as they occur.
     *
     * Pre-processing of crash requests includes:
     *
     * 1. Locking the PCCB whenever it was not locked EXTERNALLY.
     * 2. Retrieving the appropriate PB whenever an optional MSI packet was
     *	  cached within the PCCB.
     * 3. Applying the local port crash severity modifier( ESM_LPC ) to the
     *    local port crash reason code.
     * 4. Logging the crash request according to the provided crash reason.
     * 5. Optionally panicing the system.
     *
     * The presence of an optional MSI packet is indicated by the status of the
     * "optlpcinfo" local port status flag.  This flag is set when optional
     * local port crash information is cached within the PCCB, cleared
     * otherwise.
     *
     * The local port crash severity modifier is applied( Step 3 ) ONLY if the
     * local port is not already in the process of being crashed.  
     *
     * Panicing of the system( Step 5 ) immediately terminates all further
     * processing of the crash request.  Such panicing is OPTIONAL.  It is
     * requested only when the MSI configuration variable flag msi_lpc_panic is
     * set.  This flag is set only when special debugging activity is required.
     *
     * Following pre-processing this routine ascertains whether or not the port
     * has already been crashed but not yet re-initialized.  If this is indeed
     * the case, as indicated by a PCCB clean up in progress status flag, then
     * the current request is dismissed after the PCCB is unlocked( provided it
     * was unlocked within this routine ).  Otherwise, actual crashing of the
     * port commences with disablement of the local port including:
     *
     * 1. Setting the port clean up in progress flag to prohibit additional
     *    crashings of the port until it has been re-initialized.
     * 2. Taking the port offline.
     * 3. Locking the PCCB specific RFP and XFP.
     * 4. Synchronizing to any active Transmit and Receive Fork Processes.
     * 5. Flushing the SIIBUF transmit-in-progress circular queue by
     *	  deallocating all associated MSIB packets.
     * 6. Resetting the SII chip.
     * 7. Marking the local MSI port inactive.
     * 8. Unlocking the PCCB specific RFP and XFP.
     *
     * The first five steps of local port disablement( Steps 1-5 ) and Step 8
     * are executed by this routine.  The remaining two steps( Steps 6-7 ) are
     * accomplished through invocation of msi_disable(), the routine
     * responsible for disabling local MSI ports.
     *
     * Fork process synchronization( Step 4 ) is accomplished by means of the
     * in-progress SIIBUF pointers.  These pointers are never NULL except
     * during those rare circumstances when active fork processes must
     * temporarily release their locks.  Therefore, the synchronization
     * protocol just consists of releasing and re-obtaining all locks( PCCB,
     * PCCB specific XFP and RFP ) until such time as both in-progress pointers
     * are tested to be non-NULL.  The reason why such synchronization is
     * necessary is discussed at greater length below.
     *
     * Flushing the transmit-in-progress circular queue( Step 5 ) does not
     * disturb the SIIBUFs in the queue.  What occurs is deallocation of the
     * MSI packets associated with each SIIBUF in the queue.  This allows
     * recovery of their dynamically allocated memory.  Logically this action
     * should occur during local port clean up.  It MUST be done at this time
     * during the port disablement step because once the SII chip is reset(
     * Step 5 ) the SII RAM buffer may NOT be accessed.  It is perfectly safe
     * to flush the transmit-in-progress circular queue at this time even
     * though it is not the logical moment to do so.  This is because once the
     * local MSI port has been marked inactive( Step 7 ) no further attempt is
     * made either to access the elements on this queue or to add new ones.
     *
     * Resetting the SII chip( Step 6 ) stops any operation in progress,
     * disconnects the chip from the DSSI bus, returns all registers to their
     * default values, and prevents all access to the SII RAM buffer.  Marking
     * the local MSI port inactive( Step 7 ) disables all future processing by
     * scheduled XFP, RFP and XFP_TIMER threads.  The end result of both these
     * steps is to drive the local MSI port into a completely quiescent state
     * allowing for full clean up and eventual local port re-initialization.
     *
     * Synchronization to active fork processes( Step 4 ) is important in a
     * SMP environment for the following reason.  Occassions exist when an
     * active fork process must temporarily release all locks including its
     * specific fork process lock( RFP or XFP ).  Its expectations are to
     * eventually re-obtain these locks and continue with its processing.  In a
     * SMP environment lacking fork process synchronization releasing these
     * locks allows another completely independent thread to obtain them and
     * crash the local port.  Unfortunately, this almost always guarantees a
     * machine check when the fork process re-obtains its locks and resumes
     * processing.  This is because the fork process does not know the SII RAM
     * buffer has been rendered inaccessible due to crashing of the local port
     * and almost always attempts to access it anyway.  Fork process
     * synchronization protects against such machine checks by forcing
     * temporary postponement of local port crashing during those rare
     * occassions when active fork processes must temporarily release their
     * locks.
     *
     * At the time the decision is made to crash the port, the processor from
     * which the port is crashed exists in one of two states distinguished
     * mainly by whether the processor is at kernel mode or interrupt level.
     * The existence of these two possible environments does not interfere with
     * port disablement.  Unfortunately, the same is not necessary true for
     * port clean up, a section of the port driver which is quite complicated
     * in its own right.  Therefore, to avoid potential problems and to allow
     * certain code simplifying assumptions to be made, port clean up has been
     * structured into two stages, separated by both time and environment.
     *
     * The first stage of port clean up consists of those actions which should
     * be performed immediately following port disablement and are insensitive
     * to processor state.  The second stage consists of those activities which
     * need not be performed immediately following port disablement and should
     * be executed within a constant well-defined processor state.  The first
     * stage of port clean up is directed by this routine which then schedules
     * the second stage, directed by msi_clean_port(), through forking.  It is
     * this act of forking which generates the constant environment necessary
     * for the second stage of port clean up.
     *
     * The PCCB fork block is used to schedule the second stage of clean up.
     * It should always be available because it is used only for port clean up
     * and re-initialization, these activities are single threaded, and
     * re-initialization always follows clean up.  Guaranteed availability
     * of the PCCB fork block is one of the benefits of single threading of
     * port clean up and re-initialization.
     *
     * The first stage of port clean up includes:
     *
     * 1. Scheduling clean up of the local MSI port through forking.
     * 2. Unlocking the PCCB provided it was locked within this routine.
     *
     * Note that the first stage of port clean up currently does not contain
     * any processor state insensitive actions which must be immediately
     * performed following port disablement.  However, the structure exists to
     * add them as it becomes necessary to do so.
     *
     * The second stage of port clean up consists solely of notifying the CI
     * PPD of failure of the local port.  The CI PPD completes the clean up of
     * its portion of the local port including the failure and clean up all
     * paths, both formative and fully established, originating at the port.
     * Clean up of the last path triggers scheduling of port re-initialization
     * by the CI PPD.  Successful completion of port re-initialization marks
     * the beginning of the next incarnation of the port and releases all
     * restriction on crashing the port if further requests to do so are made.

/*   Name:	msi_remote_rst	- Reset Remote Port and System
 *
 *   Abstract:	This function initiates resetting of a remote MSI port and
 *		system.  The remote system need NOT be known to be reset;
 *		however, the remote port must be in the appropriate maintenance
 *		state for it and the remote system to be reset.
 *
 *		Initiating resetting of a remote port and system is
 *		accomplished by initiating transmission of a MSI port specific
 *		RST packet to the target remote port.  A MSI port command
 *		packet is used to contain the reset request.  It is allocated
 *		by this function and deallocated following packet transmission.
 *
 *		Resetting of the remote port and system can optionally be
 *		forced; however, the port must in an appropriate maintenance
 *		state for this to occur.
 *
 *              NOTE: SCA port numbers are 6 bytes in size; however, maximum
 *                    MSI port numbers only occupy 1 byte.
 *
 *		NOTE: All attempts to transmit packets to the local ports own
 *		      station address are bypassed.  The SII chip is not
 *		      capable of either internal loopback or simultaneous
 *		      transmission and reception; and, no need exists to
 *		      provide this function in software.
 *
 *   Inputs:

/*   Name:	msi_remote_strt - Start Remote Port and System
 *
 *   Abstract:	This function initiates the starting of a remote MSI port and
 *		system.  The remote system need NOT be known to be started;
 *		however, the local port must have previously reset the remote
 *		port for it to start it.
 *
 *		Initiating starting of a remote port and system is accomplished
 *		by initiating transmission of a MSI port specific STRT packet
 *		to the target remote port.  A MSI port command packet is used
 *		to contain the start request.  It is allocated by this function
 *		and deallocated following packet transmission.
 *
 *		A start address can be optionally supplied; otherwise, the
 *		default start address is used.
 *
 *              NOTE: SCA port numbers are 6 bytes in size; however, maximum
 *                    MSI port numbers only occupy 1 byte.
 *
 *		NOTE: All attempts to transmit packets to the local ports own
 *		      station address are bypassed.  The SII chip is not
 *		      capable of either internal loopback or simultaneous
 *		      transmission and reception; and, no need exists to
 *		      provide this function in software.
 *
 *   Inputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *   rport			- Station address of target remote port
 *   start_addr			- Start address( OPTIONAL )
 *
 *   Outputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *	pd.msi			-  MSI specific PCCB fields
 *	    comql		-   MSIB low priority command queue
 *	    lpstatus.xfork	-   1
 *	    xforkb		-   Transmit Fork Process fork block
 *
 *   Return Values:
 *
 *   RET_SUCCESS		- Transmission successfully initiated
 *   RET_ALLOCFAIL		- Failed to allocate command packet
 *   RET_INVLPSTATE		- Local port in invalid state
 *   RET_NOPATH			- Invalid remote port station address
 *
 *   SMP:       The PCCB is locked allowing exclusive access to PCCB contents.
 *              PCCB addresses are always valid because these data structures
 *              are never deleted once their corresponding ports have been
 *		initialized.
 *
 *		The PCCB specific COMQL is locked allowing exclusive access to

/*   Name:	msi_shutdown	- Inform Known Systems of Local Shutdown
 *
 *   Abstract:	This routine informs systems known through paths originating
 *		at a specific local MSI port of local system shutdown.  This is
 *		accomplished through disabling of the specified port.  The
 *		remote system discovers the unavailability of the port either
 *		during CI PPD polling or during utilization of the virtual
 *		circuit.  At that time it terminates its path to the port and
 *		and thus to the local system.
 *
 *		NOTE: STOP CI PPD datagrams are not transmitted across all
 *		      formative and established paths.  This is because the
 *		      state of the port is unknown and may in fact preclude
 *		      datagram transmission.
 *
 *   Inputs:
 *
 *   IPL_POWER			- Interrupt processor level
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer

 *
 *   SMP:       No locks are required.  This routine is only called(
