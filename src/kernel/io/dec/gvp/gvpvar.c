 *   Facility:	Systems Communication Architecture
 *		Generic Vaxport Port Driver
 *
 *   Abstract:	This module contains the Generic Vaxport Port Driver( GVP )
 *		internal data structures.
 *
 *   Creator:	Todd M. Katz	Creation Date:	September 23, 1985
 *
 *   Modification History:
 *
 *   27-Feb-1991	Tom Tierney
 *	ULTRIX to OSF/1 port:
 *
 *   07-Mar-1989	Todd M. Katz		TMK0002
 *	Include header file ../vaxmsi/msisysap.h.
 *
 *   02-Jun-1988     Ricky S. Palmer
 *	Removed inclusion of header file ../vaxmsi/msisysap.h
 *
 *   08-Jan-1988	Todd M. Katz		TMK0001
 *	Formated module, revised comments, increased robustness, made GVP
 *	completely independent from underlying port drivers, restructured code
 *	paths, and added SMP support.
