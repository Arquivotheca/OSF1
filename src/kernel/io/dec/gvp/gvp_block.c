 *
 *   Facility:	Systems Communication Architecture
 *		Generic Vaxport Port Driver
 *
 *   Abstract:	This module contains Generic Vaxport Port Driver( GVP )
 *		block data communication service functions.
 *
 *   Creator:	Todd M. Katz	Creation Date:	May 6, 1985
 *
 *   Function/Routines:
 *
 *   gvp_map_buf		Map Buffer
 *   gvp_unmap_buf		Unmap Buffer
 *
 *   Modification History:
 *
 *   31-Oct-1991	Pete Keilty
 *	Changed gvp_map_buf for OSF/1 mapping for msi driver.
 *
 *   27-Feb-1991	Tom Tierney
 *	ULTRIX to OSF/1 port:
 *
 *   25 May 90 -- chet
 *	Changed gvp_map_buf() to allow unmapped addresses.
 *
 *   25-May-1989	Pete Keilty
 *	Changed Dm_buffer macro to pass in the address of buffer.
 *
 *   20-May-1989	Pete Keilty
 *	Added support for mips risc cpu's double mapped buffer & pte's
 *	into a Vaxmap of the system.
 *	CI/BVP ports need to have VAX pte's and system addresses.	
 *
 *   05-Mar-1989	Todd M. Katz		TMK0003
 *	1. Include header file ../vaxmsi/msisysap.h.
 *	2. Use the ../machine link to refer to machine specific header files.
 *
 *   02-Jun-1988     Ricky S. Palmer
 *	Removed inclusion of header file ../vaxmsi/msisysap.h
 *
 *   20-Apr-1988	Todd M. Katz		TMK0002
 *	Corrected typo in gvp_unmap_buf() which prevented zeroing of the first
 *	longword of every buffer descriptor during local buffer unmapping.
 *	The typo had the unfortunate side-effect of always leaving buffer
 *	descriptors marked valid even after unmapping of the local buffers
 *	formerly referenced by them.
 *
 *   08-Jan-1988	Todd M. Katz		TMK0001
 *	Formated module, revised comments, increased robustness, made GVP
 *	completely independent from underlying port drivers, restructured code
 *	paths, and added SMP support.

    /* Local buffer mapping is accomplished as follows:
     * 
     * 1. Lock the generic Vaxport buffer descriptor database.
     * 2. Allocate a free generic Vaxport buffer descriptor.
     * 3. Unlock the generic Vaxport buffer descriptor database.
     * 4. Map the local buffer by filling in the allocated buffer descriptor.
     * 5. Construct a handle on the local buffer.
     * 6. Return an appropriate status.
     *
     * How the local buffer is actually mapped depends upon what type of buffer
     * it is.  There currently are five types of local buffers:
     *
     * 1. System buffers( physical I/O is not being done ).  The system virtual
     *	  address of the system page table PTEs which map the buffer is
     *	  computed.
     *
     * 2. Per-process buffers involved in swap operations.  The system virtual
     *	  address of the appropriate process page table PTEs which map the
     *	  buffer is computed.  The swapper's process page table is utilized
     *	  whenever the buffer is marked dirty; otherwise, the page table of the
     *	  process associated with the buffer is used.  Buffers are never marked
     *	  dirty while in process context.
     *
     * 3. Buffers containing portions of a per-process page table which are
     *	  being paged.  The system virtual address of the system page table
     *	  PTEs which map the buffer is computed.  The portion of the system
     *	  page table which maps the per-process page tables is utilized.
     *
     * 4. Process buffers located in shared memory and are marked dirty.  The
     *	  system virtual address of the PTEs which map the buffer using shared
     *	  memory structures is computed.
     *
     * 5. Buffers which are none of the above.  A separate routine is invoked
     *	  to compute the system virtual address of the process page table PTEs
     * 	  which map the buffer.  The swappers process page table is utilized
     *	  whenever the buffer is marked dirty; otherwise, the page table of the
     *	  process associated with the buffer is used.  Buffers are never marked
     *    dirty while in process context.
