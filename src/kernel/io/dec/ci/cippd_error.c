 *   Facility:	Systems Communication Architecture
 *		Computer Interconnect Port-to-Port Driver
 *
 *   Abstract:	This module contains Computer Interconnect Port-to-Port
 *		Driver( CI PPD ) error processing functions and routines.
 *
 *   Creator:	Todd M. Katz	Creation Date:	January 15, 1988
 *
 *   Function/Routines:
 *
 *   cippd_clean_fpb		Clean up Aborted Formative CI PPD Path
 *   cippd_clean_pb		Clean up CI PPD Path Following Path Failure
 *   cippd_conlog		Log CI PPD Events to Console Terminal
 *   cippd_csyslev		Process CI PPD Common System Level Events
 *   cippd_log_path		Event Log CI PPD Path Specific Events
 *   cippd_log_sys		Event Log CI PPD System Specific Events
 *
 *   Modification History:
 *
 *   31-Oct-1991	Pete Keilty
 *	Ported to OSF/1.
 *	Added OSF ifdef UERF to errlog ealloc routine.
 *	Changed memeory allocation to OSF/1 memory zones. 
 *	Routines are in scs_subr.c.
 *
 *   19-Sep-1989	Pete Keilty
 *	Add SCA errlogging levels to cippd.
 *
 *   20-May-1989	Pete Keilty
 *	Added support for mips risc cpu's 
 *	Changed splx( IPL_SCS ) to new macro Splscs()
 *
 *   06-Apr-1989	Pete Keilty
 *	Added include file smp_lock.h
 *
 *   17-Jan-1989	Todd M. Katz		TMK0006
 *	1. The macro Scaaddr_lol() has been renamed to Scaaddr_low().  It now
 *	   accesses only the low order word( instead of low order longword ) of
 *	   a SCA system address.
 *	2. Some hardware platforms require field alignments and access types
 *	   to match( ie- only longword aligned entities may be longword
 *	   accessed ).  Structure fields of type c_scaaddr present a potential
 *	   problem because they are 6 bytes long but are often treated as
 *	   contigious longword and word.  Such fields have been longword
 *	   aligned whenever possible.  However, it is not feasible to align
 *	   certain fields with this format within the CI PPD error log event
 *	   packet for compatibility reasons.  Therefore, what has been changed
 *	   for these fields is how they are accessed.  They are now accessed as
 *	   three contigious words instead of as contigious longword and word.
 *	3. Modify cippd_log_path() and cippd_log_sys() to always initialize the
 *	   CI PPD error log packet field cippd_optfmask2 to 0.
 *	4. Modify cippd_conlog() to include the local port name when
 *	   identifying the path associated with the event being reported.
 *	5. Include header file ../vaxmsi/msisysap.h.
 *
 *   23-Sep-1988	Todd M. Katz		TMK0005
 *	1. Modify cippd_conlog() to add remote port station address( CF_RPORT )
 *	   as a class of variable information displayed.
 *	2. Modify cippd_log_path() to treat all events of remote error severity
 *	   as remote port specific events for the purpose of logging them to
 *	   the console.
 *	3. Modify cippd_log_path() to completely set the remote port station
 *	   address field( cippd_rsaddr ) of the event record to undefined(
 *	   EL_UNDEF ) when the identity of the remote port is unknown.
 *	   Currently, only the low order longword of this field is being set.
 *
 *   18-Aug-1988	Todd M. Katz		TMK0004
 *	 1. Refer to error logging as event logging.
 *	 2. SCA event codes have been completely revised.
 *	 3. The following informational events( ES_I ) have been redefined as
 *	    warning events( ES_W ): TALKUP, BADSWTYPE.
 *	 4. The following informational events( ES_I ) have been redefined as
 *	     remote error events( ES_RE ): DBCONFLICT, RERROR.
 *	 5. The following informational events( ES_I ) have been redefined as
 *	    error events( ES_E ): TALKDOWN.
 *	 6. Rename the informational event( ES_IC ) mnemonic from IE -> I.
 *	 7. Modifications to cippd_conlog():
 *		1) Invalid remote port station address( CF_BADPORTNUM ) and
 *		   path information( CF_PATH ) have been eliminated and local
 *		   SYSAP( CF_SYSAPNAME ) and port( CF_LPORTNAME ) names have
 *		   been added as classes of variable information displayed.
 *		2) All event code verification checks have been redone.
 *		3) Logging of certain specific events now occurs regardless of
 *		   the current CI PPD severity level.
 *		4) Define a new arguement to the routine, event_type( type of
 *		   event being console logged ).
 *		5) The general format of all messages has been redesigned.
 *		   Path specific information is always displayed by default if
 *		   the event being logged is a path specific event(
 *		   PATH_EVENT ).  The remote system name is always displayed by
 *		   default if the event being logged is a system specific
 *		   event( SYSTEM_EVENT ).  No information is displayed by
 *		   default if the event being logged is a remote port specific
 *		   event( RPORT_EVENT ).
 *	 8. Modifications to cippd_log_sys():
 *		1) Initialize the new CI PPD event logging packet field
 *		   cippd_evpktver.
 *		2) Initialize the new CI PPD system level information
 *		   structure cippdscommon.
 *		3) Log the current number of paths to the remote system.
 *		4) Eliminate remote system software type as a class of optional
 *	    	   information logged.
 *	 9. Modifications to cippd_log_path():
 *		1) Initialize the new CI PPD event logging packet field
 *		   cippd_evpktver.
 *		2) Log the path state and current number of paths to the remote
 *		   system.
 *		3) Increment the number of errors associated with the
 *		   appropriate local port only when the severity of the current
 *		   event is error( ES_E ) or higher.
 *		4) Add new path information and local SYSAP name as classes of
 *		   optional information logged.
 *		5) This routine is now capable of logging both path and remote
 *		   port specific events.
 *	10. Modify cippd_clean_fpb() to bypass removal and deallocation of the
 *	    CI PPD datagram reserved for path establishment from the
 *	    appropriate local port datagram free queue when local port failure
 *	    was responsible for abortion of path establishment.
 *
 *   03-Jun-1988	Todd M. Katz		TMK0003
 *	1. Modify cippd_errorlog() to log path establishment failures
 *	   IE_ALLOCFAIL and IE_NORETRIES and unsupported remote system software
 *	   type informational event IE_BADSWTYPE.
 *	2. Add path( CF_RPORT ) and system software type( CF_SWTYPE ) as
 *	   classes of variable information displayed by cippd_conlog().  Also,
 *	   update the format in which various events are displayed.
 *	3. Split cippd_errorlog() into the two routines cippd_log_path() and
 *	   cippd_log_sys() to differentiate between logging of path specific
 *	   and common system level events respectively.  Modify both routines
 *	   to appropriately initialize the new CI PPD event log packet field
 *	   cippd_optfmask according to the information being logged.  This
 *	   field consists of a bit mask with a unique bit assigned for each
 *	   field optionally present within a CI PPD event log packet.
 *	4. Add System Block as an optional argument to cippd_conlog().
 *	5. Add routine cippd_csyslev() to govern both logging and bookkeeping
 *	   of common system level events.  Such events are associated with
 *	   specific remote systems and not with specific ports on those
 *	   systems.
 *
 *   02-Jun-1988	Ricky S. Palmer
 *      Removed inclusion of header file ../vaxmsi/msisysap.h
 *
 *   11-Apr-1988	Todd M. Katz		TMK0002
 *	1. Add use of Pb_fork_done() and Pccb_fork() macros in place of
 *	   straight-line code.
 *	2. Modify cippd_errorlog() to include logging of the local port name
 *	   whenever an event pertains to a specific CI PPD path.
 *
 *   15-Jan-1988	Todd M. Katz		TMK0001
 *	Formated module, revised comments, increased robustness, made
 *	CI PPD and GVP completely independent from underlying port drivers,
 *	restructured code paths, and added SMP support.

/*   Name:	cippd_clean_fpb	- Clean up Aborted Formative CI PPD Path
 *
 *   Abstract:	This routine cleans up formative paths whose establishment has
 *		been aborted due to either errors or failure of the local ports
 *		to which they are associated.  It is always invoked by forking
 *		to it.
 *
 *		The PB is deallocated following clean up.  Clean up may involve
 *		deallocation of a formative SB.
 *
 *		Scheduling of PD specific port re-initialization occurs if
 *		crash initiated clean up of the local port has completed.
 *
 *		NOTE: The appropriate port drivers are always responsible for
 *		      the removal and deallocation of all free datagram and
 *		      message buffers associated with failed local ports.  The
 *		      CI PPD must never attempt to dispose of such buffers.
 *
 *   Inputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   pb				- Path Block pointer
 *	pinfo.state		-  PS_PATH_FAILURE
 *	ppd.cippd		-  CI PPD specific PB fields
 *	    fsmpstatus.fkip	-   1
 *
 *   Outputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *	lpinfo.ppd.cippd	-  CI PPD specific local port information
 *	    nform_paths		-   Current number of formative paths
 *
 *   SMP:	The PCCB is locked to synchronize access, for PB removal from
 *		the local port formative PB queue, and for deletion of the PB 
 *		representing the formative path.  PCCB addresses are always
 *		valid because these data structures are never deleted once
 *		their corresponding ports have been initialized.
 *
 *		The PB is locked allowing exclusive access for deleting both PB
 *		and optional formative SB and as required by optional PD
 *		routines which delete emergency port specific buffers.  PB
 *		address validity is guaranteed both by single threading of path
 *		clean up and by incrementing the PB semaphore prior to
 *		scheduling of the asynchronous invocation of this routine.  The
 *		former should be sufficient to guarantee validity, but the
 *		latter is done anyway as additional protection and to detect
 *		errors in error recovery logic.
 *
 *		PB semaphores are synchronized to before path clean up is
 *		actually initiated because occasions exist elsewhere within
 *		the CI PPD when PBs must be unlocked and yet temporarily
 *		protected against the premature deletion which path clean up
 *		entails.  PB semaphores are also used to guarantee PB validity
 *		on entry to this routine.

     *
     * Synchronization to the PB semaphore( Step 3 ) is important in a SMP
     * environment for the following reason.  Occasions exist within the CI
     * PPD which require threads to temporarily release all locks, including PB
     * locks, while still protecting PBs from deletion.  PB semaphores are the

     * temporarily protect a PB, increments its semaphore prior to releasing
     * all locks.  The semaphore is decremented only after all locks have been
     * re-obtained and the need for protecting the PB in this fashion has

     *
     * The removal and deallocation of the CI PPD datagram reserved for path
     * establishment( Step 4 ) is bypassed whenever failure of the local port
     * was responsible for abortion of path establishment.
     *
     * The PCCB fork block is used to schedule port initialization( Step 8 ).
     * It should always be available because it is used only for port clean up
     * and initialization, these activities are single threaded, and
     * initialization always follows clean up.  Guaranteed availability of the
     * PCCB fork block is one of the benefits of single threading of port clean
     * up and initialization.
     *
     * One final note.  Once PB removal and deallocation completes, the CI PPD
     * is free to attempt establishment of a new path incarnation.  Such
     * attempts do not occur until after the path is re-discovered through
     * polling.  New path incarnations are fully subject to crashing on
     * encountering of sufficient serious errors.

/*   Name:	cippd_conlog	- Log CI PPD Events to Console Terminal
 *
 *   Abstract:	This routine logs CI PPD events to the console terminal.  The
 *		event is always one of the following types:
 *
 *		PATH_EVENT	- Path specific event
 *		SYSTEM_EVENT	- System specific event
 *		RPORT_EVENT	- Remote port specific event
 *
 *		Explicit formatting information must be provided for each
 *		event.  This requires updating of the following tables each
 *		time a new event is defined:
 *
 *		1. The appropriate entry within the CI PPD console logging
 *		   table( cippd_cltab[][] ) must be updated to reflect the new
 *		   maximum code represented within the associated format table.
 *
 *		2. The associated format table itself( cippd_cli[],
 *		   cippd_clw[], cippd_clre[], cippd_cle[], cippd_clse[],
 *		   cippd_clscse[], cippd_clscsse[] ) must be updated with both
 *		   the class of variable information and exact text to be
 *		   displayed.  However, the appropriate table should be updated
 *		   with a NULL entry when the CI PPD is specifically NOT to log
 *		   the new event.  This applies to cippd_clse[] when a new CI
 *		   PPD severe error event is to be specifically logged by the
 *		   appropriate port drivers only.  It also applies to
 *		   cippd_clscse[] or cippd_clscsse[] when a new SCS event of
 *		   severity error( ES_E ) or severe error( ES_SE ) respectively
 *		   is to be logged only by SCS and not by the CI PPD.
 *
 *		NOTE: Console logging of events is bypassed whenever the event
 *		      severity does not warrant console logging according to
 *		      the current CI PPD severity level( cippd_severity ).
 *		      Such bypassing is overridden when the ECLAWAYS bit is
 *		      set in the event code indicating that the event is always
 *		      to be logged regardless of the current severity level.
 *
 *		NOTE: This routine does NOT log events arising external to the
 *		      CI PPD with the exception of those SCS error and severe
 *		      error events which are candidates for application of the
 *		      path crash severity modifier( ESM_PC ).  It also does NOT
 *		      currently log any CI PPD local port specific events(
 *		      LPORT_EVENT ), all of which are candidates for
 *		      application of the local port crash severity modifier(
 *		      ESM_LPC ).  Such events( the latter ones ) have NULL
 *		      entries in the appropriate console logging format table.

/*   Name:	cippd_csyslev	- Process CI PPD Common System Level Events
 *
 *   Abstract:	This routine processes CI PPD common system level events.  Such
 *		events are associated with specific remote systems and not with
 *		specific ports on those systems.  They are normally ascertained
 *		indirectly from received CI PPD datagrams or messages although
 *		such packets are never passed to this routine.
 *
 *		CI PPD common system level event processing has a single goal:
 *		to determine whether or not a reported event should be logged.
 *		This determination is based upon whether the event has been
 *		previously reported for the system in question.  If it has,
 *		logging of new event reports is bypassed.  If it has not, the
 *		event is logged and kept track of.  This state is allowed to
 *		persist until the condition underlying the event is reported to
 *		no longer be associated with the system.
 *
 *		To allow this goal to be met this routine is called both to
 *		report the discovered presence and absence of the following
 *		CI PPD common system level events:
 *
 *		1. E_TALKDOWN  - CI PPD protocol mismatch: Can not talk down
 *		2. W_TALKUP    - CI PPD protocol mismatch: Attempt to talk up
 *		3. W_BADSWTYPE - Remote system has unsupported software type
 *
 *		The first of these events is serious as its severity level
 *		indicates.  The local CI PPD never attempts to talk down to a
 *		remote CI PPD running an earlier CI PPD protocol version.  The
 *		latter two events are less serious and require only warnings to
 *		be given.  Communication with the remote CI PPD is allowed to
 *		continue( or at least be attempted ).
 *
 *		NOTE: The static structure, event_to_flag[], within this
 *		      routine must be updated for each and every new common
 *		      system level event.
 *
 *   Inputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   cippd_sli_db		- CI PPD Common Sys Level Logging Info Database
 *   event			- W_BADSWTYPE, W_TALKUP, E_TALKDOWN
 *   sb				- System Block pointer
 *   option			- SET or CLEAR
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *	ppd.cippd		-  CI PPD specific PCCB fields
 *	    elogopt.protocol	-   CI PPD protocol information

 *

 *		modifications of the CI PPD common system level logging
 *		informational database, and to prevent SB deletion.

 *		in case logging becomes necessary.

    /* Processing of common system level events proceeds as follows:
     *
     * 1. The common system level event code is verified.
     * 2. The CI PPD system level logging information database is searched for
     *    the SLIB corresponding to the remote system associated with the event
     *	  being processed.
     * 3. The event is processed according to whether its presence or absence
     *	  is being reported.
     *
     * A bitmask is retrieved if the common system level event code is
     * satisfactorily verified( Step 1 ).  This mask designates the bit within
     * the logging flags field of the appropriate SLIB which is to be set or
     * cleared according to whether the event being reported is present or
     * absent.  A panic occurs whenever code verification is presented with an
     * unknown common system level event and fails.
     *
     * Failure to retrieve a SLIB( Step 2 ) indicates that no common system
     * level events were previously associated with the system in question.
     * This is not a problem but represents the normal situation especially
     * when it is the absence of a event being reported.  However, when it is
     * the presence of an event being reported, failure to retrieve a SLIB
     * does trigger allocation of a new SLIB to represent the system in
     * question.  This SLIB is inserted into the SLIB database from which it is
     * retrieved during processing of subsequent event reports.
     *
     * Processing of event absences( Step 3 ) is dependent upon whether a SLIB
     * corresponding to the system in question was retrieved( Step 2 ).  If one
     * was not, event processing is immediately terminated.  This is the normal
     * and preferred outcome of event processing.  If a SLIB was retrieved then
     * the bit corresponding to the absent event within the the logging flags
     * field of the retrieved SLIB is cleared.  The SLIB is itself deallocated
     * whenever the corresponding system is discovered to be currently devoid
     * of all reported common system level events.  The SLIB is removed from
     * the SLIB database before deallocation.
     *
     * Processing of event presences( Step 3 ) involves determining whether
     * existence of the reported event was previously associated with the
     * system in question.  This is accomplished by checking the appropriate
     * bit within the logging flags field of the retrieved SLIB.  If the bit is
     * set then the event was previously reported and processing of the current
     * report is immediately terminated.  If the bit is not set then existence
     * of the event was not previously detected.  The bit is set to indicate
     * observation of the event, and the occurrence of the event is logged.
     *
     * NOTE: New SLIB allocations can fail.  Such failures do not substantially
     *	     affect event processing and event detections continue to be
     *	     logged.  What is affected is the keeping track of reported events
     *	     for the system in question.  All subsequent reports of any events
     *	     associated with the system result in event loggings.  This state
     * 	     persists until such time as a SLIB can be successfully allocated,
     *       even though such multiple loggings runs contrary to the goal of
     *	     common system level event processing.

/*   Name:	cippd_log_path	- Event Log CI PPD Path Specific Events
 *
 *   Abstract:	This routine logs CI PPD path specific events.  It also

 *		received CI PPD datagram or message.  The event is also
 *		optionally logged to the console.
 *
 *		Eight classes of events are currently logged by this routine:
 *
 *		1. Path establishments.
 *		2. Path establishment failures.
 *		3. Path failures due to local port failures.
 *		4. System-wide database conflicts.
 *		5. SCS and CI PPD protocol violations.
 *		6. Local SYSAP requests for path termination.
 *		7. Remote system requests for path termination.
 *		8. Remote system requests for path restarts( ie - breakage and
 *		   re-establishment of an existing path ).
 *
 *		Of all of these events only the system-wide database conflicts
 *		are considered CI PPD remote port specific events.  The
 *		remaining events logged by this routine are CI PPD path
 *		specific events.
 *
 *		Many of these events represent serious errors and are logged to
 *		save relevant information before drastic steps are attempted to
 *		resolve them.  Others are less serious and are logged only to
 *		give a warning or for informational purposes only.
 *
 *		NOTE: While all events logged therein arise indirectly from CI
 *		      PPD packets, the logging of each event does not
 *		      necessarily involve logging of the packet itself.
 *
 *		NOTE: Only packets with CI PPD headers( CI PPD datagrams or
 *		      messages ) may be passed to this routine.
 *
 *		NOTE: This routine does NOT log events arising external to the
 *		      CI PPD with the exception of those SCS error and severe
 *		      error events which are candidates for application of the
 *		      path crash severity modifier( ESM_PC ).  It also does NOT

    /* The steps involved in logging CI PPD path specific and remote port

     *
     * 1. Logging the event to the console.
     * 2. Incrementing the counter of local port errors.
     * 3. Computing the size of the application portion of the event log

     * 4. Allocating an event log record and initializing the record's sub id
     *	  packet fields.
     * 5. Initializing the portion of the record common to all CI PPD events.
     * 6. Initializing the portion of the record reserved for identifying
     *    specific CI PPD paths.
     * 7. Moving any optional information into the record.
     * 8. Validating the event log record.
     *
     * The ability of the CI PPD to log the event is validated during console
     * logging( Step 1 ).  A panic occurs whenever the CI PPD is not prepared
     * to log the reported event.  Note that console logging only validates the
     * ability of the CI PPD to log the event, NOT the ability of this routine
     * to correctly log it.  Therefore, while all attempts by this routine to
     * log events more properly logged by cippd_log_sys() are successful,
     * important information may be loss due to this routine's unpreparedness
     * to deal with it.
     *
     * Not all events increment the counter of errors which have occurred on
     * the specified local port( Step 2 ).  Only those events with severity
     * level equal to or greater than error( ES_E ) increment the counter.
     *
     * This routine immediately terminates on failure to allocate an event log
     * record( Step 4 ).
     *
     * The size of the application portion of each event log record( Step 3 )
     * is dependent upon the presence or absence of optional information to be
     * included within the record( Step 7 ).  The following types of mutually
     * exclusive optional information may be logged:
     *
     * 1. A CI PPD datagram/message.
     * 2. Information about known and remote systems participating in a
     *	  configuration database conflict.
     * 3. New path information.
     * 4. Local SYSAP name.
     *
     * The last three types of optional information are associated with only
     * single specific events( RE_DBCONFLICT, I_NEW_PATH, and E_SYSAP
     * respectively ).  Optional CI PPD datagrams and messages are associated
     * with many different events.  They also vary widely in size unlike other
     * types of optional information whose size is fixed.  Logged CI PPD
     * packets are truncated whenever logging their full size would exceed the
     * maximum size of an event log record.
     *
     * Processing of CI PPD path and remote port specific events is for the
     * most port identical.  Even that portion of the event log record reserved
     * for identifying specific CI PPD paths is initialized for remote port
     * specific events( step 6 ).  This is because while the event may be
     * remote port specific it is discovered only during the course of
     * attempting to establish a CI PPD path.  The only notable difference
     * between logging of these two types of events is the event type passed to
     * cippd_conlog(), the routine responsible for logging CI PPD events to the
     * console terminal( Step 1 ).
     *
     * NOTE: The new path information fields( structure cippd_newpath ) are
     *	     assummed to match up 1:1 with their corresponding SB system
     *	     information fields( SIB ).
     *
     * NOTE: Currently all events of remote error severity logged by this

/*   Name:	cippd_log_sys	- Event Log CI PPD System Specific Events
 *
 *   Abstract:	This routine logs CI PPD system specific events.  Such events
 *		are associated with specific remote systems and not with
 *		specific ports on those systems.  They are normally ascertained
 *		indirectly from a received CI PPD datagram or message.  The
 *		event is also optionally logged to the console.
 *
 *		Three classes of events are currently logged by this routine:
 *
 *		 1. CI PPD protocol mismatches.
 *		 2. Remote system error log packets.
 *		 3. Software detected unsupported remote system software types.
 *
 *		Some of these events represent serious errors and are logged to
 *		save relevant information before drastic steps are attempted to
 *		resolve them.  Others are less serious and are logged only to
 *		give a warning or for informational purposes only.
 *
 *		NOTE: While all events logged therein arise indirectly from CI
 *		      PPD packets, the logging of each event does not
 *		      necessarily involve logging of the packet itself.
 *
 *		NOTE: Only packets with CI PPD headers( CI PPD datagrams or
 *		      messages ) may be passed to this routine.
 *
 *		NOTE: This routine does NOT log events arising external to the
 *		      CI PPD.  It also does NOT log any CI PPD event which is a
 *		      candidate for application of either the path( ESM_PC ) or
 *		      local port( ESM_LPC ) crash severity modifier.
 *
 *		NOTE: System specific events never increment the counter of
 *		      errors associated with any local port even when their
 *		      severity is error( ES_E ) or higher.  This is because the
 *		      event is not associated with a specific path to a remote
 *		      system; and therefore, can not be associated with any
 *		      specific local port.
 *
 *   Inputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   cippdbp			- Address of CI PPD header( OPTIONAL )
 *   event			- Event code
 *   lscs			- Local system permanent information
 *   sb				- System Block pointer
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *	ppd.cippd		-  CI PPD specific PCCB fields
 *	    elogopt.protocol	-   CI PPD protocol information
 *	    elogopt.rswtype	-   Remote system software type
 *
 *   Outputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *
 *   SMP:	The PCCB is locked( EXTERNALLY ) to synchronize access.
 *
 *		SBs NEVER require locking however they must EXTERNALLY be
 *		prevented from deletion by means of some other lock( such as a
 *		lock on the SCA database or on a PB representing a path to the
 *		system ).

    /* The steps involved in logging system specific events include:
     *
     * 1. Logging the event to the console.
     * 2. Computing the size of the application portion of the event log
     *	  record.
     * 3. Allocating an event log record and initializing the record's sub id
     *	  packet fields.
     * 4. Initializing the portion of the record common to all CI PPD events.
     * 5. Initializing the portion of the record common to all CI PPD system
     *	  specific events.
     * 6. Moving any optional information into the record.
     * 7. Validating the event log record.
     *
     * The ability of the CI PPD to log the event is validated during console
     * logging( Step 1 ).  A panic occurs whenever the CI PPD is not prepared
     * to log the reported event.  Note that console logging only validates the
     * ability of the CI PPD to log the event, NOT the ability of this routine
     * to correctly log it.  Therefore, while all attempts by this routine to
     * log events more properly logged by cippd_log_path() are successful,
     * important information may be loss due to this routine's unpreparedness
     * to deal with it.
     *
     * This routine immediately terminates on failure to allocate an event log
     * record( Step 3 ).
     *
     * The size of the application portion of each event log record( Step 2 )
     * is dependent upon the presence or absence of optional information to be
     * included within the record( Step 6 ).  The following types of mutually
     * exclusive optional information may be logged:
     *
     * 1. A CI PPD datagram/message.
     * 2. Remote and local CI PPD mismatched protocol versions.
     *
     * The last type of optional information is associated with only certain
     * specific events( W_TALKUP and E_TALKDOWN ).  Optional CI PPD datagrams
     * and messages may be associated with many different events.  They also
     * vary widely in size unlike other types of optional information whose
     * size is fixed.  Logged CI PPD packets are truncated whenever logging
     * their full size would exceed the maximum size of an event log record.
     *
     * NOTE: The common system level information fields( structure
     *	     cippd_scommon ) are assummed to match up 1:1 with their
     *	     corresponding SB system information fields( SIB ).
