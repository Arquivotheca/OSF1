 *   Facility:	Systems Communication Architecture
 *		Computer Interconnect Port-to-Port Driver
 *
 *   Abstract:	This module contains Computer Interconnect Port-to-Port
 *		Driver( CI PPD ) path maintenance service functions.  All
 *		port drivers which utilize the CI PPD for path establishment,
 *		maintenance, and termination should use these functions.
 *
 *   Creator:	Todd M. Katz	Creation Date:	May 6, 1985
 *
 *   Function/Routines:
 *
 *   cippd_crash_pb		Crash CI PPD Path Represented by Path Block
 *   cippd_get_pb		Retrieve Path Block
 *   cippd_open_pb		Transition Formative Path Block to Open State
 *   cippd_remove_pb		Remove Path Block from System-wide Databases
 *
 *   Modification History:
 *
 *   31-Oct-1991	Pete Keilty
 *	Ported to OSF/1.
 *
 *   20-May-1989	Pete Keilty
 *	Added support for mips risc cpu's 
 *	Add include file ../h/systm.h this file has define for remque
 *	insque for mips.
 *
 *   06-Apr-1989	Pete Keilty
 *	Added include file smp_lock.h
 *
 *   17-Jan-1989	Todd M. Katz		TMK0004
 *	1. The PCCB address is now part of the interface to Get_port.
 *	2. The macro Scaaddr_lol() has been renamed to Scaaddr_low().  It now
 *	   accesses only the low order word( instead of low order longword ) of
 *	   a SCA system address.
 *	3. Include header file ../vaxmsi/msisysap.h.
 *
 *   17-Aug-1988	Todd M. Katz		TMK0003
 *	1. Modifications to cippd_get_pb().
 *		1) Update the conditions under which cippd_get_pb() considers
 *		   remote port station address invalid.  Formerly, for a remote
 *		   port station address to be considered invalid it only had to
 *		   exceed the software( CI PPD ) maximum port number(
 *		   CIPPD_MAXPATHS - 1 ) and be provided to the function in the
 *		   form of buffer.  Now, not only must both these criteria
 *		   still be met; but in addition, the remote port station
 *		   address must also exceed the hardware maximum port number of
 *		   the specified local port.
 *	   	2) Invoke an appropriate port driver specific routine to log
 *		   invalid remote port station addresses.  Previously the
 *		   logging was done by the CI PPD itself.
 *	2. Modifications to cippd_crash_pb():
 *		1) Initialize the CI PPD specific PCCB field elogopt.port_num
 *		   to EL_UNDEF when it is invoked to crash an non-existent
 *		   path.  This initialization is required by cippd_log_path(),
 *		   the routine invoked to log SCS and CI PPD path crash event
 *		   codes.
 *		2) Apply the path crash severity modifier( ESM_PC ) to the path
 *		   crash reason code whenever the path has not yet been failed.
 *		3) Cache the reason code within the PB only when the path has
 *		   not yet been failed.  Cache a general reason when the path
 *		   is formative.  Cache the specific path crash reason when the
 *		   path is open.  Previously, the path crash reason was always
 *		   being cached.  This could have lead to loss of the
 *		   legitimate reason when the routine is invoked twice in quick
 *		   succession on the same path.  
 *		4) The routine parameter scsbp ALWAYS points to a character
 *		   string of size NAME_SIZE instead of to the SCS header of a
 *		   datagram/message buffer whenever SCS invokes the routine
 *		   with a reason code of E_SYSAP.  This character string
 *		   consists of the name of the local SYSAP responsible for
 *		   crashing the path.
 *		5) Add a comment as to how individual port drivers go about
 *		   crashing paths following discover of physical path specific
 *		   errors.
 *	3. Refer to error logging as event logging.
 *
 *   02-Jun-1988	Ricky S. Palmer
 *	Removed inclusion of header file ../vaxmsi/msisysap.h
 *
 *   11-Apr-1988	Todd M. Katz		TMK0002
 *	1. Add use of Pccb_fork() macro in place of straight-line code.
 *	2. Modify cippd_crash_pb() to optionally panic on requests to crash
 *	   paths.  Error recovery is the default action taken; however,
 *	   panicing occurs whenever the CI PPD configuration variable
 *	   cippd_pc_panic has been appropriately set.  This variable may be set
 *	   to trigger panicing on any path crash request or on only requests to
 *	   crash open paths.
 *	3. CI PPD event logging is now split between the routines
 *	   cippd_log_path() and cippd_log_sys() to differentiate between
 *	   logging of path specific and system level events respectively.
 *	   Modify cippd_crash_pb() and cippd_get_pb() to invoke
 *	   cippd_log_path().
 *
 *   08-Jan-1988	Todd M. Katz		TMK0001
 *	Formated module, revised comments, increased robustness, made
 *	CI PPD and GVP completely independent from underlying port drivers,
 *	restructured code paths, and added SMP support.

/*   Name:	cippd_crash_pb	- Crash CI PPD Path Represented by Path Block
 *
 *   Abstract:	This function crashes a specific CI PPD path to a known system
 *		and initiates the process by which it is disabled and cleaned
 *		up.  This routine may be sequentially invoked any number of
 *		times to crash a specific path; however, only its first
 *		invocation actually results in crashing of the path.  All
 *		subsequent invocations only log crash requests and dispose of
 *		optional buffers.  This situation persists until the next
 *		incarnation of the path which does not occur until after the
 *		path has been cleaned up, re-discovered, and re-established.
 *
 *		An optional message or datagram buffer can be provided.
 *		Alternatively an optional port command packet can be provided
 *		when this routine is invoked by the port drivers themselves.
 *		Three options exist for disposal of this optional buffer:
 *
 *		1. Buffers may be returned to the routine invocator.
 *		2. Buffers may be deallocated.
 *		3. Buffers may be inserted onto the appropriate free queue of
 *		   the appropriate local port.
 *
 *		Only datagram and message buffers may be disposed of by
 *		deallocation or placement onto an appropriate free queue.  PDs
 *		must ALWAYS request return of the buffers they provide when
 *		invoking this routine.
 *
 *		A pointer to a character string of size NAME_SIZE is ALWAYS
 *		provided in place of an optional message or datagram buffer
 *		whenever this routine is invoked with a reason code == E_SYSAP.
 *		This character string contains the name of the local SYSAP
 *		responsible for crashing the specified path.
 *
 *		The appropriate local port is crashed whenever the optional PB
 *		is not provided.
 *
 *		NOTE: Port drivers may invoke this routine following discovery
 *		      of a physical error associated with a specific path.
 *		      However, they must log the explicit physical error
 *		      themselves before invoking this routine with a "generic"
 *		      CI PPD event code( E_PD or SE_PD ) appropriate to the
 *		      severity of the physical error.
 *
 *		NOTE: When port drivers invoke this routine to crash a path,
 *		      the path may have already been disabled.  If so, they
 *		      must set the PB path_closed state bit BEFORE calling this
 *		      routine.
 *
 *		NOTE: All error recovery is bypassed in favor of immediately
 *		      panicing the system whenever the CI PPD configuration
 *		      variable flag cippd_pc_panic is appropriately set.
 *		      Normally, this flag is 0 and error recovery is the
 *		      default action taken.  It is set only when special
 *		      debugging activity is required and may be set to trigger
 *		      panicing on only requests to crash open paths or on
 *		      requests to crash any path, formative or open.
 *
 *   Inputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   cippd_pc_panic		- CI PPD path crash panic flag
 *   disposal			- RETURN_BUF or DEALLOC_BUF or RECEIVE_BUF
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *   reason			- Reason for crashing virtual path
 *   scsbp			- Address of SCS header in buffer( OPTIONAL )
 *				- Address of local SYSAP name( OPTIONAL )
 *   pb				- Path Block pointer( OPTIONAL )
 *
 *   Outputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   pb				- Path Block pointer( OPTIONAL )
 *	pinfo.reason		-  Reason for crashing virtual path
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *      ppd.cippd               -  CI PPD specific PCCB fields
 *          elogopt.port_num	-   Remote port number
 *	    elogopt.sysapname	-   Name of local SYSAP crashing path
 *
 *   SMP:	The PCCB is locked INTERNALLY whenever it was not locked
 *		EXTERNALLY prior to routine invocation.  Locking the PCCB
 *		synchronizes access; prevents premature PB deletion; and is
 *		required by cippd_log_path(), by PD routines which add
 *		datagrams or messages to appropriate local port free queues in
 *		this particular case( It is required in this particular case
 *		because the PB is locked ), and by the CI PPD finite state
 *		machine.  PCCB addresses are always valid because these data
 *		structures are never deleted once their corresponding ports
 *		have been initialized.
 *
 *		The PB is locked INTERNALLY( provided it exists ) whenever it
 *		was not locked EXTERNALLY prior to routine invocation.  Locking
 *		the PB allows exclusive access to PB contents and is required
 *		by the CI PPD finite state machine.  PB address validity must
 *		be EXTERNALLY guaranteed either through EXTERNALLY held locks
 *		or by some other mechanism.
 *
 *		Whenever the PB is locked EXTERNALLY the PCCB must also be
 *		locked EXTERNALLY.  This is because the latter occupies a
 *		higher relative position than the former within the SCA locking
 *		hierarchy.

    /* Crashing of formative and established CI PPD paths is extremely similar
     * with only a few minor differences.  These are pointed out as they are
     * encountered.  Crashing of either type of path consists of the following
     * distinct steps:
     *
     * 1. The crash request is pre-processed.
     * 2. The path is disabled.
     * 3. The path is asynchronously cleaned up.
     *
     * The first step is executed each time this routine is invoked.  It is the
     * latter two steps which constitute crashing the path and are executed
     * only once per path incarnation.  The major benefits of this single
     * threading of path crashing are the assumptions made during path clean up
     * which follow directly from it.  These assumptions greatly reduce code
     * complexity and allow extension of the CI PPD to an SMP environment with
     * a minimum of pain.  They are pointed out as they occur.
     *
     * Pre-processing of crash requests includes:
     *
     * 1. Locking the PCCB whenever it was not locked EXTERNALLY.
     * 2. Locking the PB whenever one was provided and it was not locked
     *    EXTERNALLY.
     * 3. Applying the path crash severity modifier( ESM_PC ) to the path crash
     *    reason code.
     * 4. Caching the path crash reason within the PB for latter reference.
     * 5. Caching the name of the local SYSAP responsible for crashing the path
     *	  for event logging purposes.
     * 6. Logging the crash request.
     * 7. Optionally panicing the system.
     * 8. Disposing of the optional buffer as requested.
     *
     * Steps 3 is executed only if the path is still open as only open paths
     * can be actually crashed.  Formative paths are really just prematurely
     * terminated and failed paths have already been crashed.
     *
     * Step 4 is executed only if the path has not yet been crashed.  This step
     * must only be executed once per path incarnation( ie- only if the path
     * has not yet been and is just about to be crashed ).  However, the reason
     * which is cached depends upon the state of the path at the time it is
     * crashed.  A general path failure reason is cached in PBs representing
     * formative paths.  The specific path crash reason is cached for all open
     * paths.  It is latter mapped into the appropriate general reason during
     * actual processing of the crash request.
     *
     * It is only necessary to cache the name of the local SYSAP( Step 5 )
     * responsible for crashing the path when the reason for crashing the path
     * == E_SYSAP.  In all other cases, no SYSAP is responsible for crashing
     * the path and no name exists to be cached.
     *
     * Panicing of the system( Step 7 ) immediately terminates all further
     * processing of the crash request.  Such panicing is OPTIONAL.  It is
     * requested only when the CI PPD configuration variable flag
     * cippd_pc_panic is appropriately set.  This flag is set only when special
     * debugging activity is required.  It may be set to trigger panicing on
     * requests to crash any path or on only requests to crash open paths.
     *
     * Following pre-processing this routine invokes the CI PPD finite state
     * machine to ascertain whether the path has already been crashed but has
     * not yet been cleaned up.  If this is indeed the case, as indicated by
     * current path state == PS_PATH_FAILURE, then the current request is
     * dismissed.  Otherwise, actual crashing of the path by the finite state
     * machine commences with disablement of the path including:
     *
     * 1. Mapping the specific reason for crashing the path into a more generic
     *	  reason for latter SYSAP( local or remote ) consumption.
     * 2. Disabling the CI PPD path in a PD specific fashion.
     * 3. Transmitting a CI PPD STOP datagram to the remote CI PPD to inform it
     *	  of local failure of the specified path.
     * 4. Invoking a PD specific routine to optionally invalidate the
     *	  appropriate local port translation cache.
     * 5. Incrementing the PB semaphore.
     * 6. Scheduling asynchronous PB clean up.
     * 7. Setting the path state to PS_PATH_FAILURE to prohibit additional
     *    crashings of this incarnation of the path.
     * 8. Unlocking the PB whenever it was locked INTERNALLY.
     * 9. Unlocking the PCCB whenever it was locked INTERNALLY.
     *
     * Established CI PPD paths always proceed through these nine steps.  This
     * is not always the case for formative paths, some of which do not require
     * disabling( Step 2 ) because the CI PPD has not yet enabled them.
     *
     * At the time the decision is made to crash the path, the processor on
     * which the path is crashed exists in one of two environments
     * distinguished by whether the processor is at kernel mode or interrupt
     * level.  The existence of two possible environments does not interfere
     * with path disablement.  Unfortunately, the same is not necessary true
     * for path clean up, a section of the CI PPD which is quite complicated in
     * its own right.  The solution to this potential problem is to decouple
     * path disablement from path clean up by always scheduling clean up of the
     * failed path to occur asynchronously( Step 6 ).  Now when path clean up
     * eventually commences, it always proceeds in a constant environment.
     * This avoids all potential environmental related problems and allows
     * certain code simplifying assumptions to be made.
     *
     * Prior to scheduling asynchronous path clean up, the PB semaphore is
     * incremented to prevent another CI PPD thread from deallocating the PB.
     * Actually, this incrementing is superfluous.  Only cleaned up paths are
     * deallocated and only crashed paths are cleaned up and each path may only
     * be crashed once per path incarnation.  Therefore, it is not possible for
     * another CI PPD thread to be in a position to deallocate the PB and the
     * single threaded nature of path clean up should be sufficient to
     * guarantee PB validity when scheduled clean up eventually commences.  The
     * semaphore is incremented anyway to further protect the PB and to detect
     * errors in error recovery logic.  The semaphore is always decremented
     * prior to deallocation of the PB following its clean up.
     *
     * Finally, a few additional notes on path disablement before proceeding
     * with what is involved in path clean up:
     *
     * 1. The CI PPD finite state machine never unlocks PBs while processing
     *	  path failures.  This requirement is necessary to maintain path crash
     *	  single threading by preventing other CI PPD threads from gaining
     *	  access to the PB until the state change which prohibits sequential
     *	  crashings of this path incarnation occurs( Step 7 ).
     * 2. Transmission of CI PPD STOP datagrams( Step 3 ) is currently not
     *	  supported because of VMS unwillingness to compromise during SCA
     *	  Review Group meetings.  The intent is to support such remote
     *	  notification when and if the issue is finally resolved.
     *
     * Clean up of aborted formative paths proceeds differently from clean up
     * of failed established ones and as a consequence different routines are
     * scheduled to perform each type of clean up.  The routine
     * cippd_clean_fpb() is scheduled whenever an aborted formative path is to
     * be cleaned up.  When it executes, it cleans up the specified path as
     * follows:
     *
     *  1. The PCCB is locked.
     *  2. The PB is locked.
     *  3. The PB semaphore is synchronized to.
     *  4. The CI PPD datagram reserved for path establishment is removed from
     *     the appropriate local port datagram free queue and deallocated.
     *  5. All emergency port specific buffers are optionally deallocated.
     *  6. The formative SB is  optionally deallocated.
     *  7. The PB semaphore is decremented.
     *  8. The formative PB is removed from the appropriate local port
     *	   formative PB queue, unlocked, and deallocated.
     *  9. The number of formative paths originating at the port is decremented
     *     and port initialization is scheduled through forking whenever there
     *     are no longer any paths originating at the port and port clean up is
     *	   currently in progress.
     * 10. The PCCB is unlocked.
     *
     * The routine cippd_clean_pb() is scheduled whenever a failed established
     * path is to be cleaned up.  When it executes, it cleans up the specified
     * path as follows:
     *
     * 1. The PB is locked.
     * 2. The PB semaphore is synchronized to.
     * 3. The PB is unlocked.
     * 4. SCS is notified of failure of the specified path.
     *
     * Once SCS is notified of path failure( Step 4 ), it assumes
     * responsibility for directing PB clean up including the clean up of all
     * SCS connections associated with the failed path.  Clean up of the last
     * connection triggers SCS invocation of cippd_remove_pb().  It is this CI
     * PPD routine which removes the PB from from all system-wide databases,
     * decrements its semaphore, deallocates it, and also schedules port
     * initialization through forking whenever there are no longer any paths
     * originating at the port and port clean up is currently in progress.
     *
     * SCS requires the PB address to be guaranteed at the time it is notified
     * of path failure and the same mechanisms used to guarantee PB address
     * validity on entry to cippd_remove_pb() are employed.  These are single
     * threading of path clean up so that no other thread can possibly delete
     * the PB and incrementing the PB semaphore.  The former mechanism should
     * be all that is necessary to protect the PB, but the latter is utilized
     * as further protection and to detect errors in error recovery logic.
     *
     * Prominent in the clean up of both types of paths is synchronization to
     * the PB semaphore.  Such synchronization is very important in a SMP
     * environment for the following reason.  Occasions exist within the CI
     * PPD which require threads to temporarily release all locks, including PB
     * locks, while still protecting PBs from deletion.  PB semaphores are the
     * mechanism chosen to meet this requirement.  A thread wishing to
     * temporarily protect a PB, increments its semaphore prior to releasing
     * all locks.  The semaphore is decremented only after all locks have been
     * re-obtained and the need for protecting the PB in this fashion has
     * passed.  In the interim, any thread desiring to clean up and deallocate
     * this PB must first synchronize to its semaphore before proceeding.
     *
     * The PCCB fork block is used to schedule port initialization whenever and
     * wherever such initialization becomes necessary.  It should always be
     * available because it is used only for port clean up and initialization,
     * these activities are single threaded, and initialization always follows
     * clean up.  Guaranteed availability of the PCCB fork block is one of the
     * benefits of single threading of port clean up and initialization.
     *
     * One final note on path clean up.  Once PB removal and deallocation
     * completes, no matter who does it, the CI PPD is free to attempt
     * establishment of a new path incarnation.  Such attempts do not occur
     * until after the path is re-discovered through polling.  New path
     * incarnations are fully subject to crashing on encountering of
     * sufficiently serious errors.
     *
     * It is possible for this routine to be invoked to crash a non-existent
     * path.  Typically this situation develops when some error requiring path 
     * crashing for recovery purposes is encountered, but the PB representing
     * the path can NOT be retrieved, and this routine is invoked without a PB.
     * Non-existent paths are pre-processed as if they existed, and then the
     * appropriate local ports are themselves crashed with a special reason
     * code( SE_NOPATH ).  Handling non-existent paths in this fashion allows
     * for recovery from the error to occur while still obtaining and saving
     * the maximum amount of information about the error for latter analysis.
     *
     * Path failures may also occur or be discovered within the CI PPD finite
     * state machine itself during processing of some asynchronously occurring
     * event.  This routine is invoked by the finite state machine to crash
     * such failed paths only when the paths were established at time of
     * failure.  Otherwise, processing of these formative path failures is left
     * entirely to the finite state machine.  This processing is very similar
     * to the crashing of formative paths by the finite state machine.  There
     * are a few significant exceptions and these are listed below:
     *
     * 1. The formative path is always crashable.  It is never in a
     *	  PS_PATH_FAILURE path state, nor is it ever in the process of
     *	  transitioning to such a state.
     * 2. Pre-processing of the crash request is handled internally to the
     *	  finite state machine.

 *
 *		NOTE: SCA port numbers are 6 bytes in size; however, maximum

 *		      as 4 bytes entities back and forth between the CI PPD and
 *		      its client port drivers.
 *
 *   Inputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
