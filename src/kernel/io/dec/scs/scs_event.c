 *   Facility:	Systems Communication Architecture
 *		Systems Communication Services
 *
 *   Abstract:	This module contains Systems Communication Services( SCS )
 *		event notification routines.  It includes routines invoked
 *		by port drivers to notify SCS.
 *
 *   Creator:	Todd M. Katz	Creation Date:	July 7, 1985
 *
 *   Function/Routines:
 *
 *   scs_data_done		Block Data Transfer Completed
 *   scs_dg_rec			Application Datagram Received
 *   scs_msg_rec		Sequenced Message Received
 *   scs_msg_snt		Application Sequenced Message Sent
 *   scs_new_path		New Path to System Discovered
 *   scs_path_crash		Path to System Crashed
 *
 *   Modification History:
 *
 *   15-Mar-1991	Brian Nadeau
 *	Port to OSF
 *
 *   18-Apr-1989	Pete Keilty
 *	Added smp_lock.h, and extern struct lock_t lk_scadb.
 *
 *   21-Feb-1989	Todd M. Katz		TMK0005
 *	Fix a bug introduced by TMK0004.  Modify scs_path_crash() to insure
 *	that the local variable "event" is zeroed prior to the processing of
 *	each Connection Block associated with the failed path.
 *
 *   11-Feb-1989	Todd M. Katz		TMK0004
 *	1. Add support for SCS event logging.  Log abortions of connection
 *	   establishment and terminations of fully established SCS connections
 *	   due to path failure.
 *	2. Include header file ../vaxmsi/msisysap.h.
 *
 *   20-Aug-1988	Todd M. Katz		TMK0003
 *	SCA event codes have been completed revised.  All former SCS path crash
 *	codes are now defined as either error events or severe error events.
 *	The path crash attribute is only applied by the individual port driver
 *	routines responsible for crashing paths and only when the crashed path
 *	is currently open.
 *
 *   09-Jul-1988	Todd M. Katz		TMK0002
 *	Update comments.
 *
 *   02-Jun-1988	Ricky S. Palmer
 *	Removed inclusion of header file ../vaxmsi/msisysap.h
 *
 *   08-Jan-1988	Todd M. Katz		TMK0001
 *	Formated module, revised comments, increased robustness, restructured
 *	code paths, and added SMP support.

/*   Name:	scs_data_done	- Block Data Transfer Completed
 *
 *   Abstract:	This SCS event notification routine is asynchronously invoked
 *		following PD completion of a specific block data transfer.  The
 *		PD should not have notified SCS of the failure of the path over
 *		which the block data transfer occurred although in a SMP
 *		environment this may prove unavoidable.
 *
 *		The transfer initiating SYSAP is notified of transfer
 *		completion through asynchronous invocation of the connection's
 *		control event routine and the send credit temporarily withdrawn
 *		during block data transfer is returned.  The latter may trigger
 *		notification of the appropriate SYSAP of the availability of
 *		send credits on the connection through asynchronous invocation
 *		of the connection's control event routine.
 *
 *   Inputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   lscs			- Local system permanent information
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *   lk_scadb			- SCA database lock structure
 *   scs_cbvtdb			- CB vector table database pointer
 *   scsbp			- Address of SCS header in buffer
 *				   ( READ ONLY )
 *   tid			- Transaction identification pointer
 *
 *   Outputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   cb				- Connection Block pointer
 *	cinfo.ntransfers	-  Number of block data transfers in progress
 *	cinfo.snd_credit	-  Number of send credits
 *	cinfo.status.cwait	-  0
 *
 *   SMP:	The SCA database is locked for PB retrieval.  It also prevents
 *		premature PB deletion as required by PD routines which crash
 *		paths.
 *
 *		The CB is locked to synchronize access and to prevent deletion.
 *		It is indirectly locked through its CBVTE.  Locking the CB also
 *		prevents premature PB deletion as required by scs_init_cmsb().
 *
 *		The CBVTE semaphore is incremented prior to any SYSAP
 *		notification to prevent any changes in connection state while
 *		both potential SYSAP notifications are in progress.  The
 *		semaphore is decremented following completion of all SYSAP
 *		notifications.
 *
 *		PCCB addresses are always valid allowing access to static
 *		fields because PCCBs are never deleted once SCS becomes aware
 *		of their existence.
 *
 *		NO EXTERNAL locks may be held when this routine is invoked.

     * 7. Notify the SYSAP of send credit availability on the connection if it
     *    was waiting for them to become available.
     * 8. Notify the SYSAP of the completion of its block data transfer.
     * 9. Decrement the CBVTE semaphore.
     *
     * Incrementing the appropriate CBVTE semaphore protects the connection
     * against all changes in state for the duration of both SYSAP
     * notifications and while any call backs on the connection are in
     * progress.
     *
     * The path on which the block data transfer completed is crashed under any
     * of the following circumstances:
     *
     * 1. The CB can not be retrieved.
     * 2. A connection identification number mismatch exists.
     * 3. The connection is in an inappropriate state.
     * 4. The connection does not have any block data transfers in progress.
     *
     * None of these circumstances are ever expected in a single processor
     * environment.  This explains the drastic actions taken when they occur.
     * However, the occurrence of any of these circumstances can be expected in
     * a SMP environment, albeit with an extremely low frequency, whenever a
     * path fails.  This is because no mechanisms exist to coordinate PD event
     * notifications of SCS as there are mechanisms to coordinate SCS
     * notifications of SYSAPs.  This allows PD notifications of block transfer
     * completion to actually occur after PD notifications of path failure
     * even though PDs initiate the former notifications first.  The actions
     * taken remain the same as in the single processor case even though they
     * are drastic and may well result in double crashing of the path.  There
     * is no other alternative.
     *
     * The buffer provided to this routine is READ ONLY and is only provided
     * for PB retrieval if it becomes necessary to crash the path.

 *		2. The application datagram buffer is added to the appropriate

 *
 *		NOTE: It is possible for SCS to have been previously notified
 *		      of the failure of the path over which the application
 *		      datagram was received.  This is because datagrams may be
 *		      both sent and received over failed paths.  In such cases
 *		      the datagram is just returned to the appropriate port's
 *		      free datagram buffer pool.
 *
 *   Inputs:

 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   lscs			- Local system permanent information
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *   lk_scadb			- SCA database lock structure
 *   scsbp			- Address of SCS header in datagram buffer
 *   scs_cbvtdb			- CB vector table database pointer
 *   size			- Size of application data + SCS header
 *
 *   Outputs:

 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   cb				- Connection Block pointer
 *	cinfo.dg_credit		-  Number of local datagram credits

 *		SCS of the failure of the path over which the application
 *		sequenced message was transmitted although in a SMP environment
 *		this may prove unavoidable.
 *
 *		SCS disposes of the transmitted application sequenced message

 *		2. The application sequenced message buffer is converted into a
 *		   receive message buffer for the logical SCS connection by
 *		   adding it to the appropriate port's free message pool.
 *
 *		Converting an application sequenced message buffer into a
 *		receive message buffer may trigger the explicit extension of
 *		send credits across the logical SCS connection.
 *
 *   Inputs:
 *
 *   IPL_SCS			- Interrupt processor level
 *   lscs			- Local system permanent information
 *   pccb			- Port Command and Control Block pointer
 *   lk_scadb			- SCA database lock structure
 *   scsbp			- Address of SCS header in message buffer

     *	   Otherwise, the PB is removed and deallocated when the last
     *	   connection across the path is terminated by SYSAP request.
     * 10. Unlock the SCA database.

     * Temporarily incrementing the CB count( Step 6 ) prevents PB deletion and
     * simplifies path clean up while guaranteeing the validity of the cached
     * PB address.  Locks are insufficient for this purpose because they must
     * be repeatedly released and re-established during path clean up.
     *
     * The clean up of each CB( Step 7 ) proceeds as follows:
     *
     * 1. Lock the CB.
     * 2. Synchronize to the CBVTE semaphore.
     * 3. Abort any scheduled SCS request.

     * 5. Prohibit the removal of buffers from the local port's free pools
     *    during CB clean up whenever path failure resulted from local port
     *    failure.  The buffers credited to the connection are retrieved and
     *    disposed of during clean up of the failed port itself.
     * 6. Complete CB clean up according to its connection state.
     * 7. Unlock the CB.
     *
     * Synchronizing to the CBVTE semaphore( Step 2 ) postpones processing of
     * the connection and subsequent changes in its state while call backs to
     * the corresponding SYSAP are in progress.  Failure to synchronize can
     * lead to numerous aberrant situations in SMP environments such as SYSAP
     * notification of application message reception FOLLOWING notification of
     * connection termination due to path failure.  Synchronization is
     * achieved by releasing the SCA database and CB locks and re-obtaining
     * them in the proper order until all call backs have completed( CBVTE
     * semaphore == 0 ).
     *
     * Connection state dependent clean up( Step 6 ) of open connections and
     * those partially disconnected due to remote SYSAP action is asynchronous.
     * The local SYSAP is notified of path failure through asynchronous
     * invocation of the connection's control event routine and it must
     * explicitly request connection termination.  It may do so at its leisure.
     *
     * Connection state dependent clean up( Step 6 ) of formative connections
     * initiated by the remote SYSAP but not yet responded to by the local
     * SYSAP is synchronous.  The event is logged.  The CB is removed from the
     * system-wide configuration database and is deallocated along with all
     * associated resources.  The corresponding local SYSAP is not notified of
     * this occurrence but discover it when it attempts to respond to the
     * connection request.
     *
     * Connection state dependent clean up( Step 6 ) of connections in all
     * other states is asynchronous and proceeds as follows:
     *
     * 1. Termination of the fully established or formative SCS connection due
     *	  to path failure is logged.
     * 2. The CB is removed from the system-wide configuration database.
     * 3. The CB is deallocated along with all associated resources.
     * 4. The local SYSAP is notified of connection failure through
     *	  asynchronous invocation of the connection's control event routine.
     *
     * Which specific event the local SYSAP is notified of depends upon the
     * connection's former state.
     *
     * NOTE: All locks are released prior to local SYSAP notification to allow
     *	     it to respond to the event.  The SCA database lock is
     *	     re-established following SYSAP notification but prior to obtaining
     *	     the next CB associated with the failed path.  Cached PB addresses
     *	     are valid following re-establishment of the SCA database lock
     *	     because the number of CBs associated with them was artificially
     *	     increased to prevent PB removal from the system-wide configuration
     *	     database and deletion.
     *
     * NOTE: Cached CB addresses are valid after synchronization to the CBVTE
     *	     semaphore is achieved because once path failure is reported to SCS
     *	     the only way for CBs to be deallocated is for their SYSAPs to
