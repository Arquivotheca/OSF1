/*   Name:	scs_connect	- Request Logical SCS Connection
 *
 *   Abstract:	This function initiates establishment of a logical SCS
 *		connection to a SYSAP passively listening for such connection
 *		requests.  The SYSAP is notified of the outcome of its
 *		connection request through asynchronous invocation of the
 *		connection's control event routine.
 *
 *		While the ultimate outcome of a connection request is either
 *		success or failure, there are numerous reasons why failure to
 *		establish a connection may occur.  Some of these reasons are
 *		SYSAP protocol specific.  In other situations SCS itself aborts
 *		connection establishment with one of the following reasons:
 *
 *		NOLISTENER   -	Target SYSAP does not exist on remote system.
 *		NORESOURCE   -	Insufficient resources on remote system for
 *				connection establishment.
 *		NOSUPPORT    -	Target SYSAP is not supported on remote system.
 *		BUSY	     -	Target SYSAP only supports one simultaneous
 *				connection on remote system and such a
 *				connection already exists.
 *		DISCONN	     -	Target SYSAP rejected connection without
 *				specifying a reason or initiating SYSAP
 *				unilaterally aborted connection establishment.
 *		PATH_FAILURE -	Path failed before connection was established.
 *
 *		A CB and associated resources are allocated for the new logical
 *		SCS connection.  A CBVTE is allocated to reference the new CB.
 *
 *   Inputs:
 *

 *   RET_SUCCESS		- Initiated SCS connection establishment

 *				  Failed to allocate receive datagram buffers

 *
 *   SMP:	The SCA database is locked for CBVTE allocation, CB insertion
 *		into the system-wide configuration database, and for requesting
 *		a new connection to the target SYSAP.  It also prevents PB
 *		deletion.
 *
 *		The new CB is locked prior to insertion into the system-wide
 *		configuration database even though there is no real need to do
 *		so.  It can not be accessed through its CBVTE until its
 *		connection request has been processed and is otherwise
 *		inaccessible until the SCA database lock is released.  However,
 *		locking it simplifies the interface to scs_request() and this
 *		is why it is done.  It is indirectly locked through its CBVTE.

/*   Name:	scs_disconnect	- Disconnect SCS Connection
 *
 *   Abstract:	This function terminates logical, listening, and formative
 *		SCS connections.  Connection termination may be temporarily

 *		database corruption or an unknown SCS state.
 *
 *		Connection termination always involves CB removal from all
 *		internal resource queues and the system-wide configuration
 *		database and its deallocation along with all associated
 *		resources.  The CBVTE referencing the CB is also deallocated.
 *
 *		SYSAPs are usually notified of connection termination through
 *		asynchronous invocation of their connections' control event
 *		routines.  However, the termination of listening SCS
 *		connections and those connections established across now failed
 *		paths always conclude synchronously.  No notification occurs.
 *
 *		NOTE: Termination of open connections must always be
 *		      asynchronously initiated.  All SYSAP attempts to
 *		      disconnect connections following call back on those
 *		      connections fail with a "connection busy" error.
 *
 *		NOTE: The appropriate port drivers are always responsible for
 *		      the clean up of all port specific resources associated
 *		      with failed local ports including free datagram and
 *		      message buffers.  SCS must never attempt to dispose of

     * SYSAPs are never allowed to terminate connections in either the LISTEN,
     * or OPEN connection states when asynchronous call backs to the SYSAP are
     * currently in progress on the connection.  SYSAPs are never allowed to
     * terminate connections in either the OPEN or DISCONN_REC connection
     * states when block data transfers are currently in progress on the
     * connection.  In both cases, SYSAPs should prevent further activity on
     * the connection and schedule connection termination; however, when
     * connection termination should be scheduled is different in each case.
     * Connection termination may immediately be scheduled in the former case
     * as it may well be the call back of the current thread which is
     * preventing disconnection.  In the latter case connection termination
     * should be scheduled following completion of all transfers currently in
     * progress.  SYSAPs are notified on the completion of each block data
     * transfer through asynchronous invocations of the connection's control
     * event routine.  Once scheduled connection termination commences, the
     * SYSAP should repeatedly attempt to disconnect the connection until
     * either successful or an error other than "connection busy" is returned.
     *
     * NOTE: Allowing SYSAPs to disconnect connections with call backs in
     *	     progress can lead to numerous aberrant situations in SMP
     *	     environments such as SYSAP notification of application message
     *	     reception FOLLOWING notification of connection termination.  There
     *	     is no way to prevent such situations from developing although
     *	     granted the possibility of their occurrence is extremely low.
     *	     Therefore, the decision was made to maintain a consistent meaning
     *	     to connection disconnection and avoid these situations altogether
     *	     by not allowing disconnects while call backs to the SYSAP on the
     *	     connection are in progress.  Ultimately, this requires SYSAPs to
     *	     schedule their connection disconnections.  This was thought to be
     *	     the least of all possible evils.
