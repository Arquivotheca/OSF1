/*
 *			SCS Directory SYSAP Protocol
 *
 * The SCS Directory SYSAP( SCS$DIRECTORY ) allows remote SYSAPs to query the
 * local system-wide configuration database as to the availability of specific
 * SYSAPs for logical SCS connection establishment.  Any SYSAP desiring such
 * information must first establish a connection with the local SCS$DIRECTORY
 * which accepts all such connection requests.  The SYSAP may then request
 * information about specific SYSAPs.  SCS$DIRECTORY responds to each request
 * by indicating whether or not the specified local SYSAP has made itself
 * available for receiving connection requests.
 *
 * Communication across all connections with SCS$DIRECTORY obey the SCS
 * Directory SYSAP Protocol.  This protocol defines two types of application
 * sequenced messages: 
 *
 *	1. SCS Directory Requests.
 *	2. SCS Directory Responses.
 *
 * Each query about the availability of a specific SYSAP for connection
 * establishment takes the form of a SCS directory request.  Each response to a
 * query takes the form of a SCS directory response.  SCS$DIRECTORY only
 * receives requests and transmits responses.
 *
 * There are two forms of SCS directory requests.  The first form targets
 * SYSAPs explicitly by name while the second form targets SYSAPs by their
 * directory identification number.  Thus, the former form allows the
 * connection availability of specific SYSAPs to be determined while the latter
 * allows retrieval of the names of every connection available SYSAP on a
 * specific system.
 *
 * The SCS Directory Protocol provides for flow control of requests across a
 * logical SCS connection utilizing the following simple rules:
 *
 * 	1. Each SYSAP limits the maximum number of concurrent requests it
 *	   makes.  This number is passed to SCS$DIRECTORY as the SYSAP's
 *	   minimum send credit requirement within the connection request.
 *
 *	2. SYSAPs must always specify conversion of their message buffers into
 *	   receive message buffers following transmission of their requests.
 *	   These converted buffers are used to receive the responses to their
 *	   requests.
 *
 *	3. SCS$DIRECTORY guarantees to provide a sufficient number of receive
 *	   message buffers on the connection.  The number initially provided
 *	   is sufficient to handle the case when its counterpart is
 *	   transmitting its maximum number of concurrent requests.
 *
 *	4. SCS$DIRECTORY must always specify conversion of their message
 *	   buffers into receive message buffers following transmission of their
 *	   responses.  This rules serves to maintain the number of receive
 *	   message buffers associated with the connection thereby maximizing
 *	   throughput across it.
 *
 * These simple rules together with the SCS flow control mechanisms guarantee
 * a smooth transfer of information between SCS$DIRECTORY and its counterparts.
 * The only potential problem is if the SYSAP violates rule 2.  SCS$DIRECTORY
 * is capable of detecting this condition and immediately terminates the
 * offending logical SCS connection when it occurs.
