 * pdma.h	11/07/89
 *
 * 10/11/89	John A. Gallant
 * Created this file for the pseudo DMA support code in the SCSI drivers.
 *
 * 10/17/89	John A. Gallant
 * Added a second counter to the PDMA control structure, now have one counter
 * for bytes xfered for the target and one for bytes xfered for user space.
 *
 * 10/25/89	John A. Gallant
 * Added PIPE_PREFLUSH flag define.  Added the XFER_BUFCNT() macro.
 * Added the pdma_flush() entries into the function structure.
 *
 * 11/07/89	John A. Gallant
 * Added pstate in the PDMA structure for state information, pflags is used
 * for general operation flow control.
