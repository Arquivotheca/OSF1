/*
 * bcopy(src, dst, bcount)
 *
 * NOTE: the optimal copy here is somewhat different than for the user-level
 * equivalents (bcopy in 4.2, memcpy in V), because:
 * 1) it frequently acts on uncached data, especially since copying from
 * (uncached) disk buffers into user pgms is high runner.
 * This means one must be careful with lwl/lwr/lb - don't expect cache help.
 * 2) the distribution of usage is very different: there are a large number
 * of bcopies for small, aligned structures (like for ioctl, for example),
 * a reasonable number of randomly-sized copies for user I/O, and many
 * bcopies of large (page-size) blocks for stdio; the latter must be
 * well-tuned, hence the use of 32-byte loops.
 * 3) this is much more frequently-used code inside the kernel than outside
 *
 * Overall copy-loop speeds, by amount of loop-unrolling: assumptions:
 * a) low icache miss rate (this code gets used a bunch)
 * b) large transfers, especially, will be word-alignable.
 * c) Copying speeds (steady state, 0% I-cache-miss, 100% D-cache Miss):
 * d) 100% D-Cache Miss (but cacheable, so that lwl/lwr/lb work well)
 *	Config	Bytes/	Cycles/	Speed (VAX/780 = 1)
 *		Loop	Word
 *	08V11	1	35	0.71X	(8MHz, VME, 1-Deep WB, 1-way ILV)
 *		4	15	1.67X
 *		8/16	13.5	1.85X
 *		32/up	13.25	1.89X
 *	08MM44	1	26	0.96X	(8MHz, MEM, 4-Deep WB, 4-way ILV)
 *		4	9	2.78X
 *		8	7.5	3.33X
 *		16	6.75	3.70X
 *		32	6.375	3.92X	(diminishing returns thereafter)
 *
 * MINCOPY is minimum number of byte that its worthwhile to try and
 * align copy into word transactions.  Calculations below are for 8 bytes:
 * Estimating MINCOPY (C = Cacheable, NC = Noncacheable):
 * Assumes 100% D-cache miss on first reference, then 0% (100%) for C (NC):
 * (Warning: these are gross numbers, and the code has changed slightly):
 *	Case		08V11			08M44
 *	MINCOPY		C	NC		C	NC
 *	9 (1 byte loop)	75	133		57	93
 *	8 (complex logic)
 *	Aligned		51	51		40	40
 *	Alignable,
 *	worst (1+4+3)	69	96		53	80
 *	Unalignable	66	93		60	72
 * MINCOPY should be lower for lower cache miss rates, lower cache miss
 * penalties, better alignment properties, or if src and dst alias in
 * cache. For this particular case, it seems very important to minimize the
 * number of lb/sb pairs: a) frequent non-cacheable references are used,
 * b) when i-cache miss rate approaches zero, even the 4-deep WB can't
 * put successive sb's together in any useful way, so few references are saved.
 * To summarize, even as low as 8 bytes, avoiding the single-byte loop seems
 * worthwhile; some assumptions are probably optimistic, so there is not quite
 * as much disadvantage.  However, the optimal number is almost certainly in
 * the range 7-12.
