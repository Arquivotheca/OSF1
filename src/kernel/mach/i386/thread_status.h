 * Floating point state.
 *
 * fpkind tells in what way floating point operations are supported.  
 * See the values for fp_kind in <i386/fpreg.h>.
 * 
 * If the kind is FP_NO, then calls to set the state will fail, and 
 * thread_getstatus will return garbage for the rest of the state.
 * If "initialized" is false, then the rest of the state is garbage.  
 * Clients can set "initialized" to false to force the coprocessor to 
 * be reset.
 * "exc_status" is non-zero if the thread has noticed (but not 
 * proceeded from) a coprocessor exception.  It contains the status 
 * word with the exception bits set.  The status word in "hw_state" 
 * will have the exception bits turned off.  If an exception bit in 
 * "hw_state" is turned on, then "exc_status" should be zero.  This 
 * happens when the coprocessor exception is noticed after the system 
 * has context switched to some other thread.
 * 
 * If kind is FP_387, then "state" is a i387_state.  Other kinds might
 * also use i387_state, but somebody will have to verify it (XXX).
 * Note that the registers are ordered from top-of-stack down, not
 * according to physical register number.
