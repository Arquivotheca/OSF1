-	display waiting-threads

-	Allow variables in display commands the way show does
	(e.g., display vm-map kernel_map)

-	permit specifying a thread using the syntax "cpu n", wherever
	you can now say "thread t".  This would mean the thread
	currently running on cpu n.

-	permit specifying a thread wherever a task is given, meaning
	the task to which that thread belongs.

-	provide an option to remove kernel threads from all the
	various thread displays.

-	disassembly of code

-	automatically figure out which mda version (e.g., OSDEBUG,
	non-OSDEBUG) to run.

-	more data structure displays

	CRQs
	ms_struct's
	ports
	buffer headers -- in progress
	buffer cache -- in progress
	Sockets
	in_pcb

-	MDA complains that it can't unravel a stack from some
	kernel threads when it reaches the end of the stack frame.
