The 'read' command sets up to process a crash dump file.  The one
parameter is the file name of the crash dump.  When this command is
given, mda will map the specified file, as well as the kernel image
file.  Note that the kernel image file used will be the one defined at
the time the 'read' command is given.

Most of the other mda commands require that the 'read' command has
already been issued.
