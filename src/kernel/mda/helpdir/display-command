The display command performs a formatted output of the contents of a
kernel data structure.  The data structures that may be examined are:

	active-threads		per-cpu set of running threads
	all-threads		list of all threads
	cpu-state		all cpu/board state saved at panic time
	file			a "file" structure
	inode			an inode
	registers		registers saved by the given cpu on the panic
	symbol-cache		current contents of the symbol cache
	task			a task
	thread			a thread
	utask			a task-specific u-area
	proctable		One or more entries in the process table

Several of the options require additional information (e.g., the cpu
whose saved registers are to be shown, or the address of the thread to
be displayed).  The command will prompt for any data not supplied.
