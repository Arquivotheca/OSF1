The 'find' command is a basic memory search command, with no frills.
It accepts a single data item to search for, interpreted as a 32-bit
signed integer.  The search can start at any address, so long as that
address is 0.  A dot is printed after each megabyte of physical memory
has been scanned.  The search stops at the end of the dump image.  No
mask can be specified, and every word is searched (no skipping, e.g.
it is not possible to search the first word of a series of structures).
The search terminates after the first occurrence of the requested data
has been seen.

This command provides many opportunities for enhancement.
