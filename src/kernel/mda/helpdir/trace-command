The 'trace' command displays a stack trace.  If a cpu is specified,
tracing will begin with the pc and sp at the time of the crash.  If a
thread is specified, the pc and sp registers will be taken from the
thread's pcb.

	mda>trace [cpu N] [thread ADR]

	where N is a cpu number; ADR is the address of a thread
	structure.

The tracing algorithm is a heuristic. It attempts to interpret the
contents of the kernel stack as well as divine the calling sequence
and prolog code of routines encountered along the way.  There is
"built-in" knowledge of specific kernel threads and certain kernel
entry points (e.g., svc).  Since the stack will contain an unknown
number of local variables and parameters to routines, the tracing code
will occasionally make mistakes in interpreting the stack.  When you
are suspicious of the display, check it by hand !

A future enhancement may provide (some of) the register contents on
entry to routines found as the stack is traversed.
