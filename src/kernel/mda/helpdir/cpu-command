The 'cpu' command changes the "current cpu".  Initially the master
cpu, the current cpu is used as the default for other commands that
require a cpu number.  Examples are the 'display registers' command
and the 'trace cpu' command.

Remember that cpu numbers are assigned at startup as:
	(64 * LAMP) + (4 * SLOT) + DEV
