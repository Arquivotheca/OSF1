This is the source tree for the "OSF/1 Release 1.0" Operating System
component.  Look at the script in "../setup/<MACHINE>/kernel.sh" for
information on building the files in this directory.  The first time
you run "make", it will create a config program from "./src/config" and
will generate an object directory "../../obj/<machine>/kernel/<CONFIG>"
for the configuration selected.  Once you have successfully configured
the kernel, you may use "make kernel" if you wish to avoid checking the
depenedencies and get right to building the kernel.  However, this should
only be used when you know that you configuration is up-to-date, otherwise
your changes to the configuration will not be noticed until you use "make"
without "kernel" as an argument.  Also, since the Makefile here runs a
"sub"-make to actually build the kernel, you need to pass arguments to
the sub-make through the "MAKE_ARGS" make variable.  For example, if you
only want to compile kern_exec.o, type "make MAKE_ARGS=kern_exec.o kernel".
