# HISTORY

xkeycaps is a graphical front-end to xmodmap.  It opens a window that
looks like a keyboard; moving the mouse over a key shows what KeySyms
and Modifier bits that key generates.  Clicking on a key simulates
KeyPress/KeyRelease events on the window of your choice.  It is
possible to change the KeySyms and Modifiers generated by a key
through a mouse-based interface.  This program can also write an
input file for xmodmap to recreate your changes in future sessions.
See the man page for more details.

xkeycaps currently knows about the following types of keyboards:

	Sun type2	NCD N102sf	SCO 110	
	Sun type3	NCD N108	HP 720	
	Sun type4	NCD vt220	HP PC	
	NCD N97		DEC LK201	Atari TT
	NCD N101	DEC LK401	TI Explorer
	NCD N102	IBM RS/6000

If you're using a keyboard not on this list and would like to help me
make xkeycaps know about it, send me email.  (Adding a new keyboard
type isn't hard, just a little tedious.)

I have not tested the NCD N101, NCD N108, and NCD vt220 keyboards,
because I don't have access to them.  Keyboards other than Sun type4
and NCD N97 haven't gotten extensive testing.  Please let me know if
you find any problems (especially with the "Restore Default Map"
command.)
