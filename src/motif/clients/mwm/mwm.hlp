=TITLE Parts of a Window
 Most windows include the following components:

 Component        Description

 Window frame     Surrounds a window and usually
                  consists of resize borders, a title
                  bar, a window menu button, a minimize
                  button, and a maximize button.

 Resize borders   Surround an application window and let

 Title bar        Shows the name of the application and
                  contains window management buttons
                  that you can use to rearrange your
                  screen display. Most windows have a
                  title bar.

 Window Title     Identifies the function of a window.
                  For a main window, it usually contains
                  the name of the application. For
                  a dialog box, it may also contain
                  specific information about the use of
                  the window.

 Window menu      Displays the window menu, which
 button           contains menu items for working with
                  windows.

 Minimize button  Lets you shrink a window to an icon on
                  the workspace.

 Icon             A small graphic representation of an
                  object, usually an application.

 Maximize button  Lets you increase the size of a window
                  to its maximum allowable size.

 Menu bar         Contains the names of menus you
                  can choose from to work with the
                  application.

 area             with the application.

 Matte            An optional decorative border between
                  the window frame and the work area.

2  mwm_active_windows
=TITLE mwm_active_windows
=TITLE Making Windows Active
 When you want to work with a window, you must make it
 active or give it input focus. By default an active
 window moves to the front of the stack of overlapping
 windows, and its window frame is highlighted. Any
 keystrokes you type appear in this window. When you
 make another window active, the new window is given
 input focus. Only one window can have input focus at a
 time. To make a window active:

 1. Point to a location in the window or window frame.

 2. Click MB1.

                            NOTE

      To make a window active from an icon, double-
      click MB1 on the icon.

2  mwm_moving_windows
=TITLE mwm_moving_windows
=TITLE Moving Windows
 To move a window:

 1. Position the pointer anywhere in the window's
    title bar (except on the window menu, minimize,
    or maximize buttons).

 2. Press and hold MB1.

    An outline of the window appears.

 3. Drag the window outline to the new location.

 4. Release MB1.

    If the window was partially obscured by other
    windows, by default it moves to the front of the
    stack of windows and is given input focus.

 To cancel the operation, press the Escape key (or F11).

2  mwm_sizing_windows
=TITLE mwm_sizing_windows
=TITLE Sizing Windows
 To change the size of a window:

 1. Position the pointer on one of the window's resize
    borders. The resize operation is limited by the side
    or corner that you select.

    The pointer changes into a resize cursor.

 2. Press and hold MB1.

 3. Drag the resize cursor to the size you want.

    To make the window larger, drag the resize cursor
    beyond the window border. To make the window
    smaller, drag the resize cursor inside the window
    border. The outline stops moving when the window is
    as small as it can get.

 4. Release MB1.

 To cancel the operation, press the Escape key (or F11).

2  mwm_minimizing_windows
=TITLE mwm_minimizing_windows
=TITLE Minimizing Windows
 If you have several applications running at the same
 time, you can free up space on your screen to run
 another application by minimizing a window, which
 means that you shrink the window to an icon. When
 you minimize a window, the application it represents
 continues to run and easily is accessible. All
 processes continue to execute while the application
 is stored as an icon.

 To minimize a window:

 1. Point to the window's minimize button.

 2. Click MB1.

    The window closes and its icon appears on the
    Workspace.

                            NOTE

      You can also minimize a window by double
      clicking MB1 on the window title.

2  mwm_restoring_minwindows
=TITLE mwm_restoring_minwindows
=TITLE Restoring Minimized Windows
 When you restore an icon, you open a window for that
 application. If you have more than one window open and
 restore an icon to a window, by default the new window
 is placed at the front of the stack of overlapping
 windows.

 To restore an icon to a window:

 1. Point to the icon on the Workspace.

 2. Double-click MB1.

2  mwm_maximizing_windows
=TITLE mwm_maximizing_windows
=TITLE Maximizing Windows
 If you are working with only one application, you might
 want to maximize the application window so that it is
 larger. When you maximize a window, your other windows
 and icons stay on the screen, but they are covered by
 the maximized window.

 To maximize a window:

 1. Point to the window's maximize button.

 2. Click MB1.

    The window expands to its maximum allowable size.

2  mwm_restoring_maxwindows
=TITLE mwm_restoring_maxwindows
=TITLE Restoring Maximized Windows

 you enlarged it:

 1. Point to the window's maximize button.

 2. Click MB1.

    The window returns to its original size.

2  mwm_arranging_windows
=TITLE mwm_arranging_windows
=TITLE Arranging Windows
 When you are working with stacked windows and select a
 window, it moves to the front of the stack and is given
 input focus. But if a larger window obscures a smaller
 window, you can't select that small window without
 moving the larger window out of the way. If you use the
 title bar to move the larger window, you disrupt your
 work arrangement.

 By using the window arranging options on the Workspace
 menu, you can shuffle your windows without moving them
 to another location. Shuffle Down and Shuffle Up lower
 and raise windows on the screen without affecting which
 window is active. Next Window and Previous Window
 change which window is active. By default, they also
 raise the window to the top of the screen.

 For more information about using the Workspace menu's
 options to arrange your windows, double click on an
 item from the list of additional topics below.

3  mwm_shuffle_up
=TITLE mwm_shuffle_up
=TITLE Shuffle Up
=KEYWORD Arranging Windows
 To raise the bottom-most window to the top of the
 screen, choose Shuffle Up from the Workspace menu.

 This is useful if you are working in a large window
 and want to refer to a window that is obscured. You can
 shuffle the windows on the screen until the hidden
 window is displayed and then continue to type in
 the large window. If no windows are obscuring other
 windows, then shuffling the windows will have no
 effect.

 If no windows are obscuring other windows, then
 shuffling the windows will have no effect.

3  mwm_shuffle_down
=TITLE mwm_shuffle_down
=TITLE Shuffle Down
=KEYWORD Arranging Windows
 To lower the top-most window to the bottom of the
 screen, choose Shuffle Down from the Workspace menu.

 This is useful if you are working in a large window
 and want to refer to a window that is obscured. You can
 shuffle the windows on the screen until the hidden
 window is displayed and then continue to type in
 the large window. If no windows are obscuring other
 windows, then shuffling the windows will have no
 effect.

 If no windows are obscuring other windows, then
 shuffling the windows will have no effect.

3  mwm_next_window
=TITLE mwm_next_window
=TITLE Next Window
=KEYWORD Arranging Windows
 To set focus to a previously active window, choose Next
 Window from the Workspace menu.

 This can be useful to circulate through all the windows
 on the screen. It differs from shuffling windows. Next
 Window will always go to the next window even if it
 is not obscured, and it will always make that window
 active.

 For example, if you have three windows: a clock, the
 session manager, and a DECterm, which is active. If you
 select Next Window, then the clock may become active.
 If you select Next Window again, then the session
 manager will become active. If you choose Previous
 Window, then the Clock becomes active again.

3  mwm_previous_window
=TITLE mwm_previous_window
=TITLE Previous Window
=KEYWORD Arranging Windows
 To set focus in the reverse order of Next Window,
 choose Previous Window from the Workspace menu.

 This can be useful to circulate through all the windows
 on the screen. It differs from shuffling windows. Next
 Window will always go to the next window even if it
 is not obscured and it will always make that window
 active.

 For example, if you have three windows: a clock, the
 session manager, and a DECterm, which is active. If you
 select Next Window, then the clock may become active.
 If you select Next Window again, then the session
 manager will become active. If you choose Previous
 Window, then the Clock becomes active again.

2  mwm_using_iconbox
=TITLE mwm_using_iconbox
=TITLE Using an Icon Box
=KEYWORD Icon Box
 By default, icons are displayed as separate windows on
 the screen and can be placed anywhere.

 If you want to display your icons in one central place,
 you can store them in an icon box. An icon box is a
 window that contains the icons for all the windows on
 the screen. To create an icon box, use the Icon Options
 dialog box, which is available by choosing Icons...
 from the Workspace Options submenu.

 In an icon box, if you double-click on any icon, by
 default, the window will become active and will be
 raised to top of the screen. Using the keyboard, you
 can press Return on a highlighted icon to make the
 window active from an icon. If you Shift+double-click
 on any icon, it will minimize that window. When a
 window is restored from an icon, the icon is grayed.

 If you do not use an icon box, when you restore a
 window the icon is not grayed. Instead, it is removed
 from the screen.

 To customize the position and size of the icon box,
 move and resize the icon box and select Apply Current
 Settings from the Workspace Options menu.

 You can also minimize the icon box.

=TITLE Types of Windows
 A primary window is a top-level window that can be
 minimized. An application's main window is a top-level
 window.

 A secondary window may be attached to another window,
 known as the parent window. For example, dialog boxes
 or message windows are secondary windows; they are
 usually transient in nature. A secondary window always
 moves to the top of the screen with its parent window
 and is displayed on top of its parent window. Secondary
 windows are minimized and restored with their parent
 windows.
