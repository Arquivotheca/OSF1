=TITLE Overview of the CDA Viewer
=KEYWORD Overview
 The CDA (Compound Document Architecture) Viewer
 displays files containing text, graphics, images, and
 table data when you specify the name and format of the
 input file.

 The default input file format is DDIF (DIGITAL Document
 Interchange Format). DDIF is a standard format for the
 storage and interchange of compound documents, which
 can contain text, graphics, and image elements. DDIF is
 the format in which the CDA Viewer displays all input
 files.

 You can display a file that is not in DDIF format only
 if there is a converter for the input file format. The
 CDA Viewer converts the input file format to DDIF while
 processing the file for display.

 You can also display a PostScript file when running to
 displays with servers containing the Display PostScript
 Extension.

 Some input file formats support processing options,
 which ensure minimal changes in the format and content
 of your input file while it is processed for display.
 Create an options file with the processing options you
 need before starting the CDA Viewer application. Select
 the options file and additional display options, such
 as paper size and PostScript display, when you specify
 your input file and format.

 Select Diagnostic Information... from the File menu to
 see errors reported while the input file was processed
 for display.

 The Options File window opens when you click on the
 Options File... button in the Open window. The options
 file you select contains processing options that apply
 to the particular format of your input file. These
 processing options help ensure minimal changes in
 the format and content of your input file while it
 is processed for display. An options file is a text
 file that you create before starting the CDA Viewer
 application. The default file extension for an options
 file is .cda_options.

 When you select an options file, the processing options
 apply only to the next input file you display. The
 appearance of the currently displayed file, if one
 exists, does not change.

 An options file is not required. Default processing
 options are applied automatically. However, you may
 require an options file if you need to use other than
 the default settings.

 In the Options File window, do the following:

 1. In the Directories list box, click on the name of
    the directory that contains the file you want to
    view.

 2. In the Files list box, double click on the name of
    the file; or click on the file name and then click
    on the OK button. By default, only files with the

 The Display Options window opens when you click on

 paper size and the PostScript options you select will
 override any format information stored in the file you
 wish to display.

 New settings apply only to the next input file you
 display. The appearance of the currently displayed
 file, if one exists, does not change.

 In the Display Options window, do the following:

 1. In the Default Paper Size list box, click on one of
    the paper sizes.

 2. In the Width and Height entry boxes, you can
    optionally specify paper size values other than
    the default paper sizes.

 3. Click on the characters, inches, or mm (millimeters)
    radio button to specify the unit of measurement for
    the width and height values you entered.

    The characters unit corresponds to the size of a
    character in the 12-point Courier font, which is
    the CDA Viewer's default font and which is also very
    close to the standard font used by most printers.
    In 12-point Courier, and in the character unit as
    interpreted by the CDA Viewer, there are 10 columns
    per inch (0.1 inch per character horizontally) and 6
    rows per inch (0.167 inch per character vertically).

 4. Click on the Override Document Format button to
    apply the default paper size or width and height
    values you selected.

 5. Select additional PostScript options, if the format
    of the input file you selected is PostScript. If
    you specified any format other than PostScript,
    the check buttons for these options are dimmed and
    inactive.

 6. Click on the OK button to complete selection of the

 Click and drag on the Scale Factor slider to scale the

 If the scale factor is less than 1.0, the page display
 will shrink. If the scale factor is greater than 1.0,
 the page display will expand.

 You can specify a scale factor in the range of 0.1 to
 4.0 times the size of the original page display. By

 The Use Comments check button is enabled by default, as
 indicated by the highlighted Use Comments check button.

 You can disable the Use Comments check button by
 clicking on it before opening your PostScript file.
 This is recommended when the PostScript file contains
 comments that are not correct and that cause the
 CDA Viewer either to display the PostScript file
 incorrectly or to generate an error message.

 Click on the Use Bitmap Widths check button to improve
 the screen display of your PostScript file. The
 Use Bitmap Widths option lets you view a formatted
 PostScript file with text characters spaced for bitmaps
 (screen images) rather than those designed for print.

 The file may differ slightly in appearance from
 the printed file; for example, columns may not be
 aligned precisely, or a paragraph formatted for right
 justification may appear with a ragged right margin
 instead.

 The Use Bitmap Widths check button is disabled by
 default. However, if you select the Use Bitmap Widths
 check button, the next time you open a PostScript file,
 the CDA Viewer will use bitmap widths to display your
 file.

You can create an options file prior to starting the CDA
Viewer application. An options file is a text file with
a default file extension of .cda_options.
 The options file contains all the processing options
 for your input file format. Processing options help
 ensure minimal format and content changes while the CDA
 Viewer processes your input file for display.

 An options file is not required. Default processing
 options are applied automatically when you open a file
 for display. However, you may require an options file
 if you need to use settings other than the default.

 Use the following guidelines to create an options file:

 -  Begin each line of the options file with the keyword
    for the input format, followed by one or more spaces
    or tabs, or by a slash (/).

 -  Specify only one processing option on each line.

 -  Use uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters,
    digits (0-9), dollar signs ($), and underscores (_)
    to specify the processing options.

 -  Use one or more spaces or tabs to precede values
    specified for a processing option.

 You can create an options file containing processing
