 The LinkWorks window displays the contents of a
 linkbase and lets you add, delete, and modify linkbase
 entries. You can have more than one Linkbase window
 open to work with multiple linkbases; however, a
 specific linkbase can be open in only one window.

 The Linkbase window lets you:

 -  See the contents of the linkbase

 -  Create, modify, and rename linknets, paths, linknet
    lists, and path lists

 See the list of additional topics below for information
 about tasks you can perform using the Linkbase window.

 To copy a linknet or path from another linkbase:

 1. If the other linkbase is not yet open, open a new
    Linkbase window that displays its contents (see
    Opening a Linkbase).

 2. Select the linknet or path to be copied.

 3. Use the Copy item from the Edit menu to copy the
    linknet or path to the clipboard.

 4. Optionally, select the insertion point in the
    Linkbase window. To paste the linknet or path at
    a particular place in the list, select the linknet
    or path that is immediately below where you want the
    copied linknet or path to be inserted.

    If you select a linknet list or path list, the
    copied entry is inserted in list.

    If you do not make a selection, the new linknet or
    path is inserted at the end of any existing linknets
    or paths.

 5. Choose the Paste item from the Edit menu to copy the
    linknet or path into the Linkbase window.

 6. Choose Save from the File menu to add the linknet or
    path to the linkbase.

 Note that paths within a path list are followed in
 sequence. Therefore, if you paste a path into a path
 list, be sure to choose the correct insertion point.

 2. Choose the menu item that matches the type of object
    you want to create.

    (optionally) a description for the new object.

 To delete a linknet or path list from a linkbase:

 1. Select the object in the Linkbase window.

 2. Choose the Delete item from the Edit menu. This
    removes the object from the Linkbase window display.

 3. Choose the Save item from the File menu. This
    removes the object from the linkbase.

 The Linkbase window is like an editor: your changes do
 not take effect until you save them. Thus, the object
 is not actually deleted from the linkbase until you
 save the change; however, after you save the change,
 the object cannot be recovered.

 To fill an empty linknet or path:

 1. If the linknet or path is not already in your
    Environment Manager window, copy it from the
    Linkbase window into the Environment Manager window.

 2. Double click on the Record column of the Environment
    Manager window to enable recording for the linknet
    or path.

 3. For a linknet, create links. The links are recorded
    in the linknet.

    For a path, perform Visit and Go To operations. Each
    operation records a step in the path.

 You can view the properties of a linkbase object or
 of the linkbase from the Environment Manager window or
 from a Linkbase window, as follows:

 1. Select a linknet, linknet list, path, or path list.

    select a linkbase.

    In a Linkbase window, if you do not select an
    object, the properties of the linkbase are
    displayed.

 2. Choose the Properties... item from the View menu.

    The properties are displayed in a dialog box.
