2  active_linknet
=TITLE active_linknet
=TITLE Active Linknet
=KEYWORD active linknet
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY recording_linknet
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 An active linknet is one whose links you can follow. It
 is identified by a check mark in the Activate column of
 the Environment Manager window. You can have multiple
 active linknets.

 When the LinkWorks environment is initialized, the
 Personal Links network in your linkbase is the only
 active linknet by default.

 Deactivating a linknet causes its links to be withdrawn
 from your LinkWorks environment. If highlighting is
 enabled, you will notice that highlighting of the
 linked objects in the deactivated linknet is turned
 off.

 Compare with Recording Linknet.
 

2  active_path
=TITLE active_path
=TITLE Active Path
=KEYWORD active path
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY recording_path
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 An active path is one whose steps you can follow by
 using the Step Forward menu item. An active path is
 identified by a check mark in the Activate column of
 the Environment Manager window.

 You can have multiple active paths. If more than one
 path is active, a Step Forward operation at the end
 of one path moves to the first step in the next active
 path in the Environment Manager window.

 Deactivating a path means that Step Forward operations
 do not follow its steps.

 Compare with Recording Path.
 

2  destination
=TITLE destination
=TITLE Destination
=KEYWORD destination
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY TARGET
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY ORIGIN
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 The destination of a step is the source or target
 object to which the selected object is linked. A step
 is always directed from one linked object to another;
 however, you can follow a step from a source to a
 target or from a target to a source.

 The Environment Manager window is one of two LinkWorks
 Manager windows. The other is the Linkbase window.

 The left side of the Environment Manager window lists
 the linknet lists, linknets, path lists, and paths in
 your LinkWorks environment.

 The right side of this window has columns marked
 Active, Record, and Linkbase. You can click items on
 and off in the Active and Record columns. (See the
 topics Activating Linknets and Paths and Recording
 Links in a Linknet.) The Linkbase column identifies
 the linkbase that contains each item. You can double
 click on the linkbase name to display a Linkbase window
 in which you can view and edit the contents of that
 linkbase.

 If any entries are displayed in a font different
 from other entries, see the topic Update Entries for
 information about the Update item on the Control menu.
 

2  Go_back
=TITLE Go_back
=TITLE Go Back Operation
=KEYWORD Go Back
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY history
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY go_to
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY visit
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 The Go Back operation reverses or cancels the effect of
 the most recent Visit or Go To operation. Use Go Back
 when you "change your mind" and want to return to where
 you were before the Visit or Go To operation.

 Using Go Back removes the most recent step from the
 history list. To see the history list, choose the Show
 History... menu item. You can use the history list
 to backtrack over the steps you have taken, or, by
 selecting a particular step, you can jump back a number
 of steps at once.
 

2  Go_to
=TITLE Go_to
=TITLE Go To Operation
=KEYWORD Go To
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY go_back
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY visit
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 Go To is one of two operations (Visit is the other)
 that take you from one end of a link to the other
 (source to target or vice versa). The Go To operation
 closes or minimizes (turns into an icon) the window of
 the hyperapplication you are currently using and opens
 a new window to display the linked object.

 Compare with Visit, where the current window remains
 open and an additional window is opened to display the
 linked object.
 

2  highlight
=TITLE highlight
=TITLE Highlighting
=KEYWORD highlight
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 Highlighting is an option that allows you to
 select different types of linked objects (targets,
 for example) and have them stand out from their
 surroundings, making them easy to find.

 Each hyperapplication determines the method for
 highlighting its linked objects. The light bulb icon
 is a method often used.
 

2  history
=TITLE history
=TITLE History List
=KEYWORD history
=INCLUDE glossary recording_path
=INCLUDE overview lb_task_man_nets lb_task_create_path
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 Every time you follow a link or a step, the event is
 recorded in a history list. You can use this history
 list to jump back to a previous link or step (by using
 the Show History... item on the Link Menu).

 The history list is volatile, which means that the
 information in it is lost whenever you exit LinkWorks
 Manager or when you end your session. To save any
 navigation actions, create a path: that is, enable
 recording for a path, perform the desired navigation
 operations, then disable recording for the path.
 

2  nav_list
=TITLE nav_list
=TITLE LinkWorks Environment
=KEYWORD hyperinformation environment
=INCLUDE Env_Overview nav_task_man_nets
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 Your LinkWorks environment is your personal collection
 of linknet lists, linknets, path lists, and paths that
 the Environment Manager window contains.

 When you invoke the LinkWorks Manager for the first
 time, your LinkWorks environment contains only the
 personal linknet and path created automatically for
 you the first time the LinkWorks Setup application
 (autostarted by default) ran.

 See Building Your LinkWorks Environment for
 instructions on how to add linknet lists, linknets,
 path lists, and paths.
 

2  link
=TITLE link
=TITLE Link
=KEYWORD link
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 A link connects two information objects that are stored
 and accessed by the same hyperapplication or by two
 different hyperapplications.

 When you create a link, you can write text that
 describes the relationship between the source and
 target objects. For example, you can identify "for" and
 "against" links relating to the two sides of a debate.
 

2  linkable_object
=TITLE linkable_object
=TITLE Linkable object
=KEYWORD linkable object
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 A linkable object is an object that you can select for
 linking. Each hyperapplication determines which of its
 objects are linkable objects.

 If an object is not a linkable object, you cannot make
 it the source or target of a link.
 

2  linkbase
=TITLE linkbase
=TITLE Linkbase
=KEYWORD linkbase linkbases
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 A linkbase is a file in which LinkWorks stores
 and maintains information. A linkbase can contain
 linknets, paths, linknet lists, and path lists. As
 with directories, you can use linkbases to segregate
 different working environments, and you can have both
 public and private linkbases.

 By default, you have a linkbase named lwk_personal in
 your login default (VMS) or home (ULTRIX) directory.
 However, you can cause LinkWorks to use another
 linkbase as your default personal linkbase by defining
 the VMS logical name LWK_PERSONAL or the ULTRIX
 environment variable LWK_PERSONAL to point that
 linkbase file. You can use LinkWorks Manager to create
 additional linkbases.

 With LinkWorks Manager, you can look inside linkbases
 and select from them useful linknets and paths to
 include in your LinkWorks environment. You can also
 create new linkbases.

 The Linkbase window displays the contents of a specific
 linkbase. To display this window, use the Environment
 Manager window and either double click on the linkbase
 name, or choose the Open Linkbase... item from the File
 menu and specify the linkbase in the dialog box.

 The left side of the Linkbase window lists any linknet
 lists, linknets, path lists, and paths in the linkbase.

 The right side of the Linkbase window lists the name
 of the linkbase in which the specific linknet list
 or linknet is actually stored. If the linknet list or
 linknet is stored in the linkbase you are viewing, no
 linkbase is displayed. However, if the item is merely
 a pointer to a linknet list or to a linknet in another
 linkbase, the name of the other linkbase is listed.

 For information about creating, deleting, and saving
 objects in the linkbase and about copying objects
 into your LinkWorks environment. choose Performing
 Operations in the Linkbase Window from the list of
 additional topics.
 

3  repos_oper
=TITLE repos_oper
=TITLE Performing Operations in the Linkbase Window
=KEYWORD Linkbase window
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY linkbase_window
 To create linknet lists, linknets, path lists, and
 paths, use the Create menu.

 To save objects that you create, use the Save item on
 the File menu. The Save operation stores the objects in
 the linkbase file.

 To delete an object, use the Delete item on the Edit
 menu. If you have already saved the object you want to
 delete, use the Save item on the File menu to make the
 deletion effective in the linkbase file.

 To transfer an object that you created into your
 LinkWorks environment, use the Copy item on the Edit
 menu. Then, in the Environment Manager window, use the
 Paste item on the Edit menu. If you select an object of
 the same type before performing the paste operation,
 the copied object is inserted before the selected
 object.

 You can also use the "quick copy" method: click MB1 on
 an object to select it, move the mouse pointer to where
 you want the object inserted, then click MB2 to copy
 the object.
 

4  rationale
=TITLE rationale
=TITLE Rationale for These Operations
=KEYWORD Linkbase window
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY linkbase_window
 The Linkbase window is based on the editing model, not
 the transaction model.

 In the transaction model, changes take effect
 immediately. In the editing model, changes are stored
 in a buffer in memory and are not made permanent
 (stored on disk) until you explicitly save them.

 The editing model gives you flexibility in creating
 objects, editing them before saving them, and
 selectively including them in and removing them from
 your LinkWorks environment.
 

2  network
=TITLE network
=TITLE Linknet
=KEYWORD linknet
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 A linknet is a collection of links.

 You can use linknets to place links in meaningful
 groups, such as "comments on the User's Guide" or
 "training plans."
 

2  net_list
=TITLE net_list
=TITLE Linknet List
=KEYWORD linknet list
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 A linknet list is collection that can contain linknets
 and linknet lists. The contents of the linknet list
 (linknets or linknet lists, or both) can be located in
 the same linkbase or in different linkbases.

 For example, each reviewer of a document could create
 a linknet in which comments on electronic cards are
 linked to sections of the document. When the author
 wants to revise the document, he or she can create a
 linknet list that contains all the reviewers' linknets.
 The author would then activate the linknet list and
 enable highlighting for all sources and targets, to
 see all of the document sections affected by reviewer
 comments.
 

2  object
=TITLE object
=TITLE Object
=KEYWORD object
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY linkable_object
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 An object is a piece of information displayed by an
 application. Some objects are small, basic units of
 information, representing a simple concept that cannot
 be decomposed. Other objects represent a collection
 of related ideas and, therefore, would take up a great
 deal of space. For example, the following might be
 application objects:

 -  A word in a paragraph, a paragraph in a chapter, a
    chapter in a book, a book in a library, the library

 -  An element in a picture, a region of a picture, a
    picture

 An object that can be the source or target of a link is
 a linkable object. (See Linkable object in the list of
 additional topics).
 

2  origin
=TITLE origin
=TITLE Origin
=KEYWORD origin
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY SOURCE
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY DESTINATION
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 The origin of a step is the source or target object
 that is selected when you perform a Visit or Go To
 operation. A step is always directed from one linked
 object to another; however, you can follow a step from
 a source to a target or from a target to a source.

 Compare with Destination.
 

2  orphan
=TITLE orphan
=TITLE Orphan
=KEYWORD orphan
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 An orphan is an object that either (1) was linked to
 another object but is not linked to that object any
 more, or (2) has been selected as a source and a Start
 Link operation has been performed, but the link has not
 yet been completed.
 

3  orphans_exam
=TITLE orphans_exam
=TITLE Example of an Orphan
 Assume that a Cardfiler card is the source of a link
 and a Calendar timeslot is the target. You select the
 timeslot and delete the link (using the dialog box
 generated by the Show Links... menu item). The timeslot
 and the card are now orphans.
 

2  path
=TITLE path
=TITLE Path
=KEYWORD path
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 A path is a route through the information space, that
 is, a series of steps (navigation operations) that have
 been recorded. When you follow a path, each step in
 the path replays the original navigation operation. For
 example, if the original navigation operation was a Go
 To operation, your Step Forward operation on that path
 step results in the same Go To operation.
 

2  path_list
=TITLE path_list
=TITLE Path List
=KEYWORD pathlist
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 A path list is a sequence that can contain paths
 and path lists. The contents of the path list can be
 located in the same linkbase or in different linkbases.

 The sequence of items in a path list is significant.
 If you have activated a path list, a Step Forward
 operation at the end of one path in the list moves
 to the first step in the next path in the path list.
 By contrast, the sequence of items in a linknet list is
 not significant.
 

2  current_source
=TITLE current_source
=TITLE Pending Source and Pending Target
=KEYWORD pending source target
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 The pending source is the most recently selected source
 for which a Start Link operation was performed but for
 which the link has not yet been completed.

 The pending target is the target you most recently
 selected before you chose the Complete Link... menu
 item and clicked on the OK button in the Complete
 Link... dialog box. When you click on the OK button,
 the object is no longer the pending target, but instead
 is the target of the link.

 Creating the link usually removes the pending status
 of both source and target, but you can specify Retain
 Pending Source when you create a link. Retaining the
 pending source makes it easy to create a series of
 links from one source.

=INCLUDE overview lb_task_man_nets lb_task_create_path
=INCLUDE csh lwk_obj_props
=INCLUDE glossary linkable_object
=INCLUDE glossary orphan
=INCLUDE glossary target
=INCLUDE glossary source
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 Every link and linked object has a set of properties
 associated with it. For example, the properties of a
 link are relationship, source, target, and description.

 In some cases, these properties are filled in
 automatically when the object is created, although
 you can override default properties in the dialog box
 that is displayed when you create the object.

 You can view and edit an object's properties by
 selecting the object and then doing the following:

 -  For objects in LinkWorks Manager windows, choose the
    Properties... item on the View menu.

 -  For linked objects in hyperapplications, use the
    dialog boxes generated by the Show Links... and Show
    History... items on the Link menu.
 

2  recording_linknet
=TITLE recording_linknet
=TITLE Recording Linknet
=KEYWORD recording linknet
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY active_linknet
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 The recording linknet is the linknet into which links
 that you create are recorded. The recording linknet is
 identified by a check mark in the Record column of the
 Environment Manager window. You can have at most one
 recording linknet at a time.

 When the LinkWorks environment is initialized,
 the Personal Links network in your linkbase is the
 recording linknet by default.

 If you disable all recording (that is, specify no
 recording linknet), you cannot create new links.

 Compare with Active Linknet.
 

2  recording_path
=TITLE recording_path
=TITLE Recording Path
=KEYWORD recording path
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY active_path
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 The recording path is the path into which your
 navigation (Go To and Visit) operations are recorded.
 The recording path is identified by a check mark in
 the Record column of the Environment Manager window.
 When you are finished recording steps in a path, double
 click in the Record column to remove the check mark.

 You can have at most one recording path at a time. When
 the LinkWorks environment is initialized, there is no
 default recording path.

 Compare with Active Path.
 

2  source
=TITLE source
=TITLE Source
=KEYWORD source
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY TARGET
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 The source in a link is the object that was selected
 when the user chose the Start Link item on the Link
 menu.

 You can follow a link in either direction. That is, you
 can select either the source or the target and perform
 a Visit or Go To operation.

 Compare with Target.
 

2  step
=TITLE step
=TITLE Step
=KEYWORD step
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 A step is a navigation operation (Go To or Visit) from
 a source to a target or from a target to a source.

 You can perform a step either by selecting an object
 and choosing the Visit or Go To menu item, or by
 choosing the Step Forward item when you are following a
 path.
 

2  target
=TITLE target
=TITLE Target
=KEYWORD target
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY DESTINATION
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY SOURCE
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 The target in a link is the object that was selected
 when the user chose the Complete Link or Complete
 Link... item on the Link menu.

 You can follow a link in either direction. That is, you
 can select either the source or the target and perform
 a Visit or Go To operation.

 Compare with Source.
 

2  Visit
=TITLE Visit
=TITLE Visit Operation
=KEYWORD visit
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY go_back
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY go_to
=INCLUDE GLOSSARY
 Visit is one of two operations (Go To is the other)
 that take you from one end of a link to the other (from
 the source to the target or from the target to the
 source). The Visit operation keeps the current window
 open, and it opens an additional window to display the
 linked object.

 Compare with Go To, which closes or minimizes (turns
 into an icon) the window of the hyperapplication you
 are currently using and opens a new window to display
 the linked object.
