 and linkbase management functions for hyperapplication
 users and developers. You can:

 -  Select a linknet into which you can record links

 -  Select linknets whose links you want to see

 -  Create and follow paths

 -  Set LinkWorks Manager session defaults

 -  Create and maintain personal and public linkbases

 See the list of additional topics below for more
 information about the Environment and Linkbase windows
 and about LinkWorks Manager menus and functions.

 LinkWorks Manager has two windows, the Environment
 Manager window and the Linkbase window.

 The Environment Manager window is created when
 LinkWorks Manager is started. It displays the objects
 in your LinkWorks environment and allows you to control
 this environment. There is only one Environment Manager
 window.

 You can create a Linkbase window when you want to view
 or edit the contents of a linkbase. You can create
 several Linkbase windows, each displaying a separate
 linkbase.

 See Environment Manager window and Linkbase window from
 the list of additional topics for more information on
 each window's contents.
 

2  env_File_menu
=TITLE env_File_menu
=TITLE Environment Manager Window File Menu
=KEYWORD environment file

 The File menu allows you to open a linkbase or to exit
 LinkWorks Manager.

 You can create a new linkbase by choosing the Open
 Linkbase... item and then entering a file name that
 does not match the file name of an existing linkbase.

 The Open Linkbase... menu item displays the Open
 Linkbase dialog box, which lets you select a linkbase
 to open. A new Linkbase window is created to display
 the contents of the linkbase.

 If the linkbase that you specify does not exist, the
 Create Linkbase dialog box is displayed in which you
 enter the name for the new linkbase.

 The Exit menu item shuts down the LinkWorks Manager
 application.

 Changes that you make in the Environment Manager window
 take effect immediately, and therefore you are not
 asked whether you want to save changes when you exit
 the Environment Manager window.

 clipboard into a new entry in the window.

 If you have not selected an entry, or if the entry
 you selected is not the same type as the entry in the
 clipboard, the new entry is inserted at the end of the
 appropriate segment in the window.

 If you selected an entry of the same type as the entry
 in the clipboard, the new entry is inserted before the
 current entry.

 The Paste menu item is disabled if the clipboard
 is empty or if the clipboard contains an entry not
 relevant to LinkWorks Manager.

 The Expand/Collapse menu item controls the level of
 detail in the display of the currently selected linknet
 list or path list. If you choose Expand, entries in the
 list are displayed. If you choose Collapse, entries in
 the list are not displayed.

 The wording of this menu item depends on whether
 the selected linknet list or path list is currently
 displayed in expanded or collapsed form.

 The Expand/Collapse menu item is disabled if you have
 not selected a linknet list or path list.

 The Properties... menu item displays a dialog box that
 lets you view and modify the properties of the selected
 linkbase, linknet list, linknet, path list, or path.
 (See Create or View Object Dialog Box from the list of
 additional topics.)

 This item is disabled if you have not selected a
 linkbase or an object. Note that this behavior is
 different from the Linkbase window, in which the
 absence of a selection causes the properties of the
 linkbase to be displayed.

=INCLUDE Env_Overview env_Control_menu
 The Activate menu item adds the selected linknets,
 paths, or lists to your LinkWorks environment.

 The Deactivate menu item removes the selected linknets,
 paths, or lists from your LinkWorks environment.

 The wording of this menu item is Activate or
 Deactivate, depending on whether or not the selected
 object (or the last object, if several are selected) is
 active. If it is active, the item says Deactivate; if
 it is not active, the item says Activate.

 A more convenient way to activate and deactivate
 objects is to double click in the Active column of
 the Environment Manager window.
 

3  env_Control_recording
=TITLE env_Control_recording
=TITLE Start/Stop Recording
=INCLUDE Env_Overview env_Control_menu env_Control_activate
=INCLUDE Env_Overview env_Control_menu
 If you enable recording, subsequent hypernavigation
 events are recorded in the selected linknet or path.
 (Links are recorded in a linknet; navigation steps are
 recorded in a path.)

 If recording is enabled for a linknet, recording in any
 other linknet is automatically disabled. Likewise, you
 can record in a single path only.

 The wording of this menu item is Start Recording if
 recording is disabled for the selected linknet or path,
 and it is Stop Recording if recording is enabled for
 the selected object linknet or path.

 This item performs the same functions as double
 clicking the check mark on (Start Recording) or
 off (Stop Recording) in the Record column of the
 Environment Manager window.

 The Start/Stop Recording menu item is disabled unless
 you have selected a single linknet or path.
 

3  env_Control_update
=TITLE env_Control_update
=TITLE Update Entries
=INCLUDE Env_Overview env_Control_menu
=INCLUDE glossary environment_window
 The Update item on the Control menu updates any
 selected entries in the Environment Manager window,
 including any invalid entries.

 An invalid entry is one that does not appear in the
 linkbase listed for it. For example, if you delete a
 path from a linkbase but forget to delete it from your
 environment, the Environment Manager window entry for
 the path is invalid.

 Invalid entries are displayed in a font different from
 other entries.

 For each invalid entry, you must either update it using
 the Update item on the Control menu or delete it using
 the Delete item on the Edit menu.

 The Update item is disabled if you have not selected
 any entries.

=TITLE Building Your LinkWorks Environment
=INCLUDE Env_Overview
 You can add linknets, linknet lists, paths, and path
 lists to your LinkWorks environment by copying them
 from a Linkbase window into your Environment Manager
 window.

 With paths and path lists, the order in which they
 appear in the Environment Manager window is important.
 When you set more than one path active (by check marks
 in the Active column), a Step Forward operation at
 the end of one path moves to the beginning of the
 next path, using the order of the active paths in the
 Environment Manager window.

 With linknets and linknet lists, the order in which
 they appear in the Environment Manager window has no
 impact on LinkWorks features and operations.

 To add a linknet to your LinkWorks environment:

 1. Open a Linkbase window that displays the linkbase
    containing the linknet.

 2. In the Linkbase window, select the linknet.

 3. Choose the Copy item from the Edit menu to copy the
    linknet to the clipboard.

 4. Optionally, select the insertion point in the
    Environment Manager window. To paste the additions
    at a particular place in the list, select the
    linknet that is immediately below where you want
    the linknet to be inserted.

    If you do not select a linknet, the new linknet is
    inserted at the end of any existing linknets.

 5. Choose the Paste item from the Edit menu in the

    linknet.

 2. Choose the Delete item from the Edit menu.

 Removing a linknet from the Environment Manager
 window merely removes the linknet from your LinkWorks

 the linkbase. You can copy the linknet back into the

 2. Double click on the Active column for the linknet or
    path.

 Activating linknets and paths active allows all
 hyperapplications to use them. In other words, you
 cannot follow links in a linknet unless the linknet is
 active, and you cannot follow steps in a path unless
 the path is active.

 To turn off the active state, double click again on the

    A Linkbase window is opened, displaying any linknet
    lists, linknets, path lists, and paths contained in

 To create a new linkbase, follow the instructions for
