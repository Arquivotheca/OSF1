 Context-sensitive help is provided for dialog boxes and

 and so forth).
 

2  linkbase_sel_box
=TITLE linkbase_sel_box
=TITLE Open Linkbase Dialog Box
=INCLUDE Env_Overview nav_task_open_rep
 Use the Open Linkbase dialog box to open a LinkWorks
 Manager linkbase. A Linkbase window will be created
 displaying the contents of the linkbase.

 In the Selection entry box, enter the name of the
 linkbase you want to open.

 If the linkbase you specify does not exist, a dialog
 box for creating a new linkbase is displayed. The new
 linkbase will be opened after it is created.

=TITLE Create Linkbase Dialog Box
=INCLUDE CSH lwk_obj_props repos_name_note
=INCLUDE Env_Overview env_File_menu env_File_open
 Use the Create Linkbase dialog box to create a new
 LinkWorks Manager linkbase.

 Enter a name for the linkbase in the Name entry box.
 This name appears in LinkWorks Manager window displays.
 You can make the linkbase name the same as the file
 name, but you do not need to. (The name you choose can
 be based on personal preference or group standards.)

 The File entry is filled in based on the file name you
 entered in the Linkbase Selection box.

=TITLE lwk_obj_props
=TITLE Create or View Object Dialog Box
=INCLUDE glossary properties
 This dialog box is used to create a linknet list,
 linknet, path list, or path; or to display the
 properties of an existing linknet list, linknet, path
 list, path, or linkbase. This dialog box is generated
 by the Create menu and by the View menu's Properties...
 item.

 The title of the dialog box indicates the type of
 object, and the properties shown are those appropriate
 for that object.

 The Name entry box contains the name of the object. If
 you are creating the object, you must enter a name. If
 you are viewing an existing object, you can change its
 name.

 The Description entry box, if present, lets you enter a
 comment describing the object.
 

3  repos_name_note
=TITLE repos_name_note
=TITLE Note on Linkbase Name and File Name
=INCLUDE CSH lwk_obj_props
 Changing a linkbase name does not affect the file name
 of the linkbase. The linkbase name is simply a property
 of the linkbase. Operating system commands that affect
 file names do not affect the linkbase name.
 

2  cust_lwk_env_box
=TITLE cust_lwk_env_box
=TITLE Environment Options Box
 The Environment Options Box lets you display and modify
 the following LinkWorks Manager Environment attributes:

 -  Highlight Defaults

 -  Link Defaults

 -  Go To/Visit Defaults

 These attributes affect the default behavior of all
 hyperapplications.

 The options you choose here will be reflected in every
 hyperapplication, but you can override these defaults
 through Link Menu items and dialog box entries as you
 are using hyperapplications.

=INCLUDE CSH cust_lwk_env_box
=INCLUDE CSH cust_lwk_env_box navigation_defaults
=INCLUDE CSH cust_lwk_env_box link_defaults
 The highlight defaults buttons affect:

 -  Whether or not highlighting is enabled. If
    highlighting is enabled, linked objects are
    highlighted by their hyperapplications.

    The Highlight button enables and disables
    highlighting.

 -  Which types of objects are highlighted.

    The object type buttons specify types of objects for
    which you can enable and disable highlighting. These
    buttons are disabled (dimmed) if highlighting is
    disabled.

 You can override these values for any hyperapplication
 by using the Turn Highlight On/Off and Highlight...
 menu items in the application's Link menu.

=INCLUDE CSH cust_lwk_env_box
=INCLUDE CSH cust_lwk_env_box navigation_defaults
=INCLUDE CSH cust_lwk_env_box highlight_defaults
 The link defaults entries establish defaults for each
 link that you make:

 -  The Retain Source check button determines whether
    or not the source remains pending (selected as the
    source for the next link) after a link is created.

 -  The Relationship entry box describes the
    relationship between the source and target objects.
    The default is "Is Linked To," and you should keep
    that unless you have text that is more suitable for
    most of the links that you plan to create.

    For each link that you create, you can edit the
    Relationship text for each link by using the Show
    More... dialog box when you create the link. For
    example, you can document links that you expect
    other users to follow.
 

4  retain_add_info
=TITLE retain_add_info
=TITLE Retain Source: More Information
 By default, the pending source designation is removed
 after you create a link, although you can override
 this when you create the link by retaining the pending
 source. You might want to make retaining the pending
 source the default if you usually link each object to
 many other objects; otherwise, leave the default as it
 is.

=TITLE navigation_defaults
=TITLE Go To/Visit Defaults
=INCLUDE CSH cust_lwk_env_box
=INCLUDE CSH cust_lwk_env_box highlight_defaults

 These options determine the defaults for Go To and
 Visit operations:

 -  Select Destination determines whether or not the
    destination object is already selected when it is
    displayed.

 -  Destination Operation is a pop-up menu that lets
    you set a default operation to be performed on
    the destination object. The available choices are
    Default (performs the default operation as defined
    by the object's hyperapplication), View, Edit, and
    Activate.
 

2  cust_lwk_manager_box

 The Manager Options dialog box lets you specify whether
 the LinkWorks Manager starts as a window or as an icon.

 state.
 

2  buttons
=TITLE buttons
=TITLE OK, Apply, Reset, Cancel, and Help Buttons
 OK performs the action or makes the changes you
 specify, dismisses the dialog box, and returns control
 to LinkWorks Manager.

 Apply performs the action or makes the changes you
 specify without dismissing the dialog box. (Apply lets
 you see the effect of your changes without saving the
 changes.)

 Reset's meaning depends on the purpose of the dialog
 box. In a dialog box that lets you create an object,
 the Reset button clears all user-modifiable entry
 boxes. In a dialog box that lets you display and edit
 information, the Reset button restores the entry boxes
 to their last saved state.

 Cancel returns control to LinkWorks Manager without
 saving any changes that you have made to the
 information in the dialog box.

 Help displays information about the dialog box or
 message box.

 The message box displays error, warning, and
 informational messages. The meaning of the message
 and the action you should take depend on the specific
 context.

 If you attempted an operation that is illegal or
 that is irrelevant to the selected object or in the
 current situation, select the correct object and try
 the operation again, or do not attempt that operation.

 If there seems to be a problem with your linkbase, with
 the LinkWorks Manager environment, or with the system,
 contact your system manager or your Digital support
 specialist.
