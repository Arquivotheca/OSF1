<head1>(Brief History of the Gregorian Calendar\history)
<p>
 As decreed by Pope Gregory XIII, October 4, 1582, was
 followed by October 15, 1582. Thus ended the 1600-year
 reign of the Julian calendar upon which the Gregorian
 calendar is based, and thus began the calendar which
 DECwindows Calendar uses to measure time. 
<p>
 Calendars based on sun and moon movement were used even
 by the ancients, but the first reasonably accurate one
 was the 365-day cycle calculated by the Greek
 Sosigenes. This was the calendar authorized by Julius
 Caesar in 46 B.C. The Julian calendar (not to be
 confused with the Julian period; see below) had 3 years
 of 365 days each, followed by a fourth year of 366
 days. 
<P>
 The 365-day cycle was more accurately defined in 730
 AD by the Venerable Bede, an Anglo-Saxon monk, who
 shortened the time by 11 minutes, 14 seconds. This
 accumulates to a whole day's error every 128 years, or
 a little more than 3 days every 400 years. This being
 the Dark Ages, nothing was done to adjust the Calendar,
 despite Roger Bacon sending a note to Pope Clement IV,
 informing him of the drifting of the date for the
 vernal equinox. Later, Pope Sixtus IV did become
 convinced that another reform was needed and called the
 German astronomer Regiomontanus to Rome to advise him.
 Unfortunately, Regiomontanus died of the plague shortly
 thereafter and the plans died with him. 
<p>
 Thursday, October 4, 1582 was the next time the
 calendar was adjusted. This last day of the Julian
 calendar was followed by Friday, October 15. So began
 the Gregorian calendar that we use today, named after
 Pope Gregory XIII. He commissioned the mathematician
 Father Christopher Clavius, S.J., to do the necessary
 calculations, having been authorized to reform the
 calendar by the Council of Trent in 1545. 
<p>
 The Vatican librarian Aloysius Giglio provided a
 formula for long-range accuracy. He suggested that
 every fourth year be a leap year, except for century
 years that are not divisible by 400. Thus 1700, 1800,
 and 1900 would not be leap years, but 2000 would be,
 because 2000 is divisible by 400. This rule eliminated
 3 leap years every 4 centuries, making the calendar
 sufficiently correct for most ordinary purposes.

<HEAD2>(Political Acceptance in Europe\political_background_europe)
<p>
 The new calendar was adopted at once by France, Spain,
 Italy, Portugal, and Luxembourg. By 1584, Belgium, parts
 of the Netherlands, Switzerland, and most Catholic
 German states had joined, and by 1587, so had Hungary.
 It was not until 1699-1700 that these countries were
 joined by the rest of the Netherlands, Denmark, and the
 Protestant German countries. 
<p>
 By the time the British imposed the calendar on all its
 possessions, in 1752, 11 days needed to be lost.
 September 2, 1752, was thus decreed to be followed by
 September 14. In addition, New Year's day was moved
 back from March 25 to January 1. (For example, before,
 March 24, 1700 had been followed by March 25, 1701).
 Among other repercussions, this moved Washington's
 birth date from February 11, 1731, to February 22,
 1732. The following year, 1753, Sweden too adopted the
 calendar. 
<p>
 In 1793, the French Revolutionary government adopted a
 calendar of 12 months of 30 days each, with 5 extra
 days in September (6 on leap years). The Gregorian
 calendar was reinstated in 1806 by Napoleon.

 In 1918, Russia's revolutionary government decreed that

<HEAD2>(Julian Period\calendar_background_julian)
<P>
 Astronomers use the Julian period because it is
 convenient to express long time intervals in days
 rather than months, weeks and years. It was devised by
 Joseph Scaliger, in 1582, who named it after his father
 Julius, thus creating the confusion between the Julian
 (Caesar) calendar and the Julian (Scaliger) period. 
<P>
 Julian Day 1 began at 12:00 noon, January 1, 4713 B.C.
 This date was thought by some to correspond
 approximately to the beginning of the universe.
 Certainly it predated any known astronomical events
 known in the 16th century without resorting to negative
 times. Scaliger decided on the actual date on the
 grounds that it was the most recent coincidence of
 three major chronological cycles: 

<list>(unnumbered\-)
 <le>The 28-year solar cycle, after which dates in the
   Julian calendar (for example September 27) return to
   the same days of the week (for example Tuesday).
                                                                 
 <le>The 19-year lunar cycle, after which phases of the
   moon return to the same dates of the year.
                                                                 
 <le>The 15-year indiction cycle, used in ancient Rome for
   tax regulation. 
<endlist>
<p>  
 It takes 7980 years to complete the cycle. Noon of
 January 1, 1988, marks the beginning of Julian Day
 2447161. 
<p>
 The Julian period is also of interest because of its
 use as a time base by the <reference>(VMS_name) operating system.

<HEAD3>(<reference>(VMS_name) and the Julian Period\julian_and_vms)
			
<p>
 Why <reference>(VMS_name) regards November 17, 1858 as the beginning of
 time... 
<P> 
 The modified Julian date adopted by SAO (Smithsonian
 Astrophysical Observatory) for satellite tracking is
 Julian Day 2400000, which turns out to be November 17,
 1858. 
<P>
 SAO started tracking satellites with an 8K (nonvirtual)
 36-bit IBM 704 in 1957 when Sputnik went into orbit.
 The Julian day was 2435839 on January 1, 1957. This is
 11225377 octal, which was too big to fit into an 18-bit
 field. With only 8K of memory, the 14 bits left over by
 keeping the Julian date in its own 36-bit word would
 have been wasted. They also needed the fraction of the
 current day (for which 18 bits gave enough accuracy),
 so it was decided to keep the number of days in the
 left 18 bits and the fraction of a day in the right 18
 bits of one word. 
<P>
 Eighteen bits allows the truncated Julian day (the SAO
 day) to grow as large as 262143, which from November
 17, 1858, allowed for 7 centuries. Possibly, the date
 could only grow as large as 131071 (using 17 bits), but
 this still covers 3 centuries and leaves the
 possibility of representing negative time. The 1858
 date preceded the oldest star catalogue in use at SAO,
 which also avoided having to use negative time in any
 of the satellite tracking calculations.

<list>(simple)
<le>Thursday January 1 00:00:00 1970

 The reason for this date being chosen is that this was
 the year that UNIX, the <quote>(parent) of <reference>(ULTRIX_name), was first
 released.

 Thus dates prior to 1970 are BU; 1970 and later dates
 are AU.

<P>
 If you read the topics concerning the political and
 religious acceptance of the Gregorian calendar, you
 will see that there is a problem: there are many dates
 for the conversion from the Julian to the Gregorian
 calendar. For example, the British (and therefore the
 Americans) converted in September 1752, so British and
 American Calendar users might expect Calendar to show
 September 2, 1752, to be followed by September 14,
 1752. However, a Russian user would expect to see this
 jump between January 31, 1918, and February 14, 1918. 
<P>
The  DECwindows Calendar conforms to the date of the
 original decree, therefore no days have been lost since
 Friday, October 15, 1582, nor since the beginning of
 DECwindows Calendar time: January 1, 1600. Thus for
 everyone except for users from the majority of the
 Catholic European countries, which all converted before
 this date, there will appear to be an "error" in
 Calendar, where the conversion actually took place.
 This generalization was felt to be acceptable for an
 application not specifically designed for historians.

Calendar serves as a desktop calendar and
 appointment book. 

Calendar can 
 help you schedule your appointments and remind you of
 them. 
<P>
 You can use several calendars for different purposes. 
 For example, a group can share a calendar for making
 conference room reservations.  
<p>
Calendar is a hyperapplication.  Through the Link menu, you can make and 
follow links between pieces of information.

 Before you try to create an entry, click on a
 timeslot and familiarize yourself with the various
 components of Calendar's entry area. From
 left to right, they are:
<list>(unnumbered\-)
<le>Timeslot, containing the time (highlighted after
   you click on it)
<le>Entry handle (a slot that contains icons)
<le>Resize bar (a thin vertical bar)
<le>Text area
<endlist>
<p>
 Note that the entry handle and the resize bar are
 not visible unless you click on the timeslot.
<p>
 To create a brief entry, click on one of the timeslots.
 That timeslot becomes highlighted, and a blinking 
 cursor appears in the text area next to the
 timeslot. 
<p>
 To create a longer entry (for example, to show the time
 span of a meeting), click and drag downward on the timeslot.
<p>
 You can then type an entry into the text area next to
 the timeslot. To complete your entry, click on
 the timeslot. The highlighting disappears. 
<p>
 To edit an existing entry, first open the entry by
 clicking in the text area. Then use the usual editing
 functions to make the changes.  To close the entry again, click on the
 timeslot.

 in a separate view when scheduling events in their own
 calendars. Because the Open menu item can open a

<p>
Calendar is a hyperapplication.  Through the Link menu, you can make 
and follow links between pieces of information (linkable
objects). The information at the other end of any link can be another
Calendar object or an object accessed by any other hyperapplication.
<p>
Calendar's linkable objects are:
<list>(unnumbered)

<le>Timeslot entry
<le>Day
<le>Month
<le>Year

<endlist>
<p>
For example, you can link a timeslot entry to another timeslot entry, 
or to a Bookreader topic, or to a Cardfiler card.
However, you cannot link a portion of text within an entry to
something else.
<P>
Timeslot entries that are linked can be highlighted.
If highlighting is enabled, Calendar highlights linked entries by including
a light bulb icon in the entry handle. If highlighting is not enabled and 
you want to see which entries have links, choose Turn Highlight On from 
the Link menu to enable highlighting.  (To prepare for the 
reverse action, the menu item changes to Turn Highlight Off.)

<HEAD4>(Show AM/PM\am_pm)
<P>
 Calendar uses a 12-hour time system with A.M. and P.M. in 
 its Day view for both the clock and the timeslots.  
<p>
 You can change to a 24-hour time system by disabling 
 Show AM/PM in the General dialog box, which you can access from the
 Options menu. If you make this change, 1:30 P.M. becomes 
 13:30, and so on.

 Enabling the Live Scrolling option causes the Day view to scroll

 Setting this option has the same effect on the slider
 in the scroll bar for the miniaturized months that are displayed

 Calendar defines the start and finish times for the 
 work day as 8:30 A.M. and 5:30 P.M., respectively. The Day
 view for any day initially displays timeslots for this
 period.
<P>
 You can change these times to suit your normal work day by
 changing the Start and Finish times in the Day View dialog
 box, which you can access from the Options menu. To adjust
 the settings, click on the hour or minute box. Each click
 increases the time in increments of 1 hour or 5 minutes.
 Alternatively, press and hold MB1 to increase the time
 continuously; release MB1 when you reach the desired time.  
This method provides
 a quick way to make extensive time changes.

 option, new entries and Day Notes are not flagged by
 default.
<P>
 Use the Flag option to flag entries and Day Notes that 
 are significant. Enabling the Flag option changes the font
 of the specified day in Month views. Entries that you 
 do not flag as significant do not change font when you
 make an entry. Therefore, you cannot tell from the
 Month view which days contain entries.

<le>Show Length. This mode stacks overlapping entries
   so that the left side of each entry is always visible, 
   thereby revealing the sequence of the entries. Entries
   that start and end at the same time are always displayed
   in this manner.

<le>Show Text. This mode stacks partially overlapping entries 
   so that the first line of each entry is visible (although 
   the entries overlap), thereby revealing the
   content of the entries.

<P>
 The Day view looks like a page from a traditional desk
 calendar.  The Day view provides times of day, with 
 timeslots for entries, and this month and next month's
 calendar.
<P>
 Unlike a traditional calendar, the Day view features a
 digital clock, which has several features that affect the
 behavior of the Day view.  The Day view also has vertical
 bars beside the timeslots; these bars indicate working
 hours and appointments.

<HEAD4>(Day View Clock\clock)
<P>
 The Day view clock provides a digital display of the
 current time. In addition, the clock
 allows the current Day view to scroll automatically
 (autoscroll). The clock has no border when it is
 autoscrolling.
<P>  
 To start autoscrolling, click on the clock. The timeslots
 that are visible in the Day view adjust so that the
 current time appears within the first timeslot.
 Thereafter, as a timeslot passes, it scrolls off the top
 of the window, which keeps the view as up to date as
 possible.  
<P>
 The clock performs this function for only the current
 day. If the Day view is not the current day, clicking on
 the clock first replaces the displayed day with the
 current day. Autoscrolling then takes place as usual. 
<P>  
 To stop autoscrolling, move the timeslots by
 any other method. For example, click on the scroll
 bar. Autoscrolling is turned off at the end of the day. 
<P> 
 If you are making an entry in a timeslot when it is due
 to be scrolled, the entry does not "disappear." The
 scroll mechanism waits until the next interval is over
 and then catches up.

backward, and within the month displays
you can use the arrow keys.

 Day view.

 In addition to showing the current time, the clock allows

 timeslots that are visible in the Day view to adjust so
 that the current time is always within the first
 displayed timeslot.
<P>
 If the displayed day is not the current day (today),
 clicking on the clock in the Day view also causes
 the current day to be displayed instead.

<HEAD2>(Handle\handle)
<P>
 A handle is the area in a calendar entry between the
 timeslot and the resize bar. The handle serves a number of
 purposes.
<P>
 Its primary function is to allow you to move an entry to
 a different timeslot by holding MB1 down on the entry and
 dragging the entry to the new location.
<P>
 When entries overlap, clicking on a handle causes that
 entry to pop to the front.
<P>
 A handle also displays the icons that are associated with
 the entry (for example, an alarm icon is displayed if you
 have an alarm set for the entry). Most of the icons are
 set from the Entry Editor.

 Calendar attaches no meaning to the icons. They are for
 you to use as reminders of the content of a particular
 entry.

 the upper "weight" to drag the top edge of the entry, or
 the lower "weight" to drag the bottom edge. Drag the
 entry edge to the earlier or later time you want.
<P>
 You can set the resize bar to finer time increments than
 those indicated in the Day view. This is useful if, for
 example, you charge for time in 3-minute increments
 but like to keep 15-minute intervals
 on the display.

 You can set the increment used by the resize bar from the
 Day view dialog box. See the help topic Choosing a Time

 This feature is preset in the standard Calendar and is
 useful if you have relatively few entries. To disable
 flagging in the Month view, use the Flag options in
 the Day view dialog box.
<P>
 An alternative method of flagging significant days is to
 choose Special from the Mark submenu of 
the Edit menu. This method of flagging does not
 require the day to have any entries or Day Notes, and it
 can be set for any number of specific days.

 A timeslot is the unit of time in the Day view. You can set timeslots
 to 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes. You can also select multiple
 timeslots and join them to create entries
 that last longer than the default timeslot. 
<P>
 You can set finer intervals of time for entries (down to
 1 minute) with the resize bar. By default, the resize bar uses an
 interval
 of 5 minutes, but you can modify
 it in the Day view dialog box.

<condition>(VMS)
If you are using the logical name DECW$CALENDAR_FILE, make sure that it is

 your datafile, or provide write access for the
 currently specified file. 

<HEAD2>(Datafile is Already Open for Exclusive Access\database_error_locked)
<P>
 For a given DECwindows Calendar datafile, the access
 granted depends on the file protection of the datafile.
 DECwindows Calendar supports either one user (session)
 with exclusive write access to its datafile or
 multiple users (sessions) with read-only access.
<p>
 Mixed read and write access to the same datafile is not
 possible. You can open any read-only datafile or
 any write-access datafile that is not currently opened
 by another user. 
<P>
 In your case, another DECwindows Calendar session has
 already opened the specified datafile for exclusive
 write access, so your request to access it is denied. 
<P>
 If you must open the datafile, ask the current user to
 close it. Otherwise, try again later. 

<HEAD2>(Include File Error\errorinclude)

<HEAD2>(Altering a Repeating Entry\repeatquestions)
<P>
 Repeating entries are Calendar entries that are made on one
 occasion and then automatically repeated at regular
 intervals (for example, every week). 
<P>
 If you attempt to modify or delete one of these
 entries, you must decide whether you want to
 affect this one occasion (as if it were a single
 event) or every such occasion from now on.
<P>
 You can also modify individual occurrences. This is useful
 if, for example, you are looking at a day in the future
 that contains a repeat entry and you decide to make a change.
 Instead of returning to the first occurrence of the entry,
 you can modify a future entry by using the Entry Editor.
 When you exit from the Entry Editor, a dialog box asks you
 whether you want the changes you made to be applied in:
<list>(unnumbered\-)
<le>Just this instance
<le>This and all future instances

       a - z        underscore (_)
       hyphen (-)   dollar sign ($)
<endcode_example>
<P>
 A file name is a 1- to 39-character string that
 provides a name for a file. 
<P>
 A file type is a 1- to 39-character string that
 usually identifies the file in terms of its contents. File
 types must be preceded by a period.  For example, if you
 had a Calendar file containing appointments, you might name
 it APPOINTMENTS.DWC.

 There is no straightforward way to change this
 characteristic. If you must make entries outside this time
 period, you must use a Calendar application specifically
 designed for that purpose.

<HEAD2>(Clipboard Contents Not Understood by Calendar\error_clipboard_bad_format)
<P>
 The clipboard can contain data in many formats, some of
 which are incompatible with Calendar.
<P>
 The only way to copy such data into Calendar is first to 
 open an entry and then to try to paste the contents of the
 clipboard into the entry. If this operation does not work, the
 data is incompatible with Calendar and cannot be copied
 into it.
 
<HEAD2>(Entry or Day Note Not Closed\error_close_entries)
<P>
 You have tried to perform a task (such as removing the Day
 Note window or changing work days) that requires all
 entries or Day Notes to be closed, but some remain open. 
<P>
 Check that no Day Notes or entries are open in the current
 Day view. Open entries or Day Notes that are not associated with the
 current day must have an editor dialog box open, so closing
 all of these closes any remaining open entries or Day
 Notes. Try your task again.

<HEAD2>(Impossible Configurations\error_unconfigurable)
<P>
 Most likely, you have changed too many settings in the Day view
 dialog box without checking the results. 
<p>
Reset the box (by
 clicking on Reset), then change a few settings
 and click on Apply.  
<p>Continue this process until
 you have created a display that is acceptable to both you
 and Calendar.

<HEAD2>(Including an Empty File\error_empty_file)
<P>
 Although you performed the correct procedure, the file you
 included contained nothing. Check the file name and, if you
 are on an <reference>(VMS_name) system, the version number. If these are both
 correct, the problem is with the file itself.
 
<HEAD2>(Including a File Too Large for an Entry\error_entry_too_big)
<P>
 Calendar could not save the entry because the file you
 tried to include was too large.
<p>You can
 either leave the data as a file outside Calendar and
 put a reference to that file in the calendar entry, or
 you can find a way to shorten the file.
 
<HEAD2>(Including Too Much Data for One Day\error_day_too_big)
<P>
 Although the current entry is not large, you
 have exceeded the limit that Calendar allows for any one
 day. Most likely, you have one or more entries that contain
 large amounts of data.
<P>
 A solution to this problem is to copy the large entry to a
 file outside Calendar, and then put a reference to that
 file in the calendar entry.

<HEAD2>(There is No PostScript Header File\error_cant_get_prolog)
<P>
 The PostScript file you tried to create does not have a header and
 therefore cannot be printed. Re-creating the file is not
 likely to correct the problem. See your system manager for
 help.
 
<HEAD2>(Unable To Cold Start Calendar\error_cold_start_fail)
<P>
 An attempt to follow a connection in Calendar has
 failed. This failure probably indicates that the connection
 is no longer valid and should be deleted.

<HEAD2>(Dangling Connection\error_dang_conn)
<P>
 The destination of this connection has been deleted.
 This connection should probably be deleted.

<HEAD2>(HyperInformation DRM File Not Found\error_hisdrmnotfnd)
<P>
 The file defining the HyperInformation Services user interface
 cannot be found. Check the system installation of
 the HyperInformation Services.
<P>
 Calendar should continue to run but without the
 HyperInformation Services.

<HEAD2>(Active Network List Query Failed\error_netquery_fail)
<P>
 An attempt to query the Active Network List has
 failed.  Use the LinkWorks Manager application to reset the Active Network
 List.

<HEAD2>(HyperInformation Services Error\error_hisservices_fatal)
<P>
 HyperInformation Services has been unable to
 complete the requested operation.
<P>
 This error indicates that there may be repository
 corruption, and HyperInformation Services may be
 curtailed. 
<p>Report the error to someone
who is  familiar with the HyperInformation environment.
<P>
 Calendar should continue to run but without the
 HyperInformation Services.

<HEAD2>(HyperInformation Services Warning\error_hisservices_warn)
<P>
 HyperInformation Services has
 been unable to complete the requested operation.
<p>
 This message is a warning.  Calendar should continue to run 
but you should report the error to someone who is familiar with the
 HyperInformation environment.
