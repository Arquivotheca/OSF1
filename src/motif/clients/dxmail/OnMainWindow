 The Main Window displays your mail folders and lists
 the messages in the currently opened folder.

 When you receive new messages, Mail draws a border
 around your inbox folder.

 The message push buttons are not highlighted until you
 select a message by clicking MB1 on the message or
 the envelope icon.


 Message push buttons apply to either a single selected
 message or a group of selected messages.
