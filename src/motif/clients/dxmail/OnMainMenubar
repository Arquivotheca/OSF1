 The Main Window displays your mail folders and lists
 the messages in the currently opened folder.

 When you receive new messages, Mail draws a border
 around your inbox folder.

 Messages are selected by clicking MB1 on the message or
 the envelope icons.

 Message push buttons apply to either a single selected
 message or a group of selected messages.
