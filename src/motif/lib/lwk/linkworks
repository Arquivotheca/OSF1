=TITLE LinkWorks
=TITLE Overview of LinkWorks Support
 LinkWorks support in DECwindows allows users to create
 and follow links between pieces of information that
 are stored and accessed by various hyperapplications. A
 hyperapplication is a DECwindows application that has
 a Link menu. This menu lets users create links, follow
 links (to see what is at the "other end" of a piece
 of linked information), and use other hyperapplication
 features.

 Choose Link Menu from the list of additional topics for
 information about the Link menu and its items.

 If the Highlight button is on, clicking on the Orphans
 button causes the hyperapplication to highlight all
 orphan objects.

 An orphan can be either of the following:

 -  An object that was linked to another object but is
    not linked to that object anymore

 -  An object that has been selected as a source and
    a Start Link operation has been performed, but the
    link has not yet been completed
 

4  orphans_exam
=TITLE orphans_exam
=TITLE Example of an Orphan
 Assume that a Cardfiler card is the source of a link
 and a Calendar timeslot is the target. You select the
 timeslot and delete the link (using the dialog box
 generated by the Show Links... menu item). The timeslot
 and the card are now orphans.

 If an object participates in multiple links, it can
 be an orphan in some links and a source or target in
 others. Using the example in the preceding paragraph,
 if the Calendar timeslot is the source and a Bookreader
 topic the target in a separate link, deleting the
 timeslot's link to the card does not affect its link
 to the book topic. In this case, the timeslot is both a
 source (with respect to the topic) and an orphan (with
 respect to the card).

 If the Highlight button is on, clicking on the Pending
 Source button causes the hyperapplication to highlight
 the pending source object. The pending source is the
 most recently selected object for which a Start Link
 operation was performed but for which the link has not
 yet been completed. You can have at most one pending
 source in your hyperinformation environment.

 Highlighting just the pending source or pending target
 (as opposed to all sources or targets) can be useful
 when you are creating many links.

=INCLUDE LinkWorks hlight c_source
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU conn_tasks conn_high
=INCLUDE LinkWorks hlight
 If the Highlight button is on, clicking on the Pending
 Target button causes the hyperapplication to highlight
 the pending target object. The pending target is the
 target you most recently selected before you chose
 the Complete Link... menu item and clicked on the
 OK button in the Complete Link... dialog box. When
 you click on the OK button, the object is no longer
 the pending target, but is instead the target of the
 link. You can have at most one pending target in your
 hyperinformation environment.

 Highlighting just the pending source or pending target
 (as opposed to all sources or targets) can be useful
 when you are creating many links.

 The Links frame is a box within the Show Links dialog
 box that lists the links associated with the currently
 selected object.

 Each link has two lines that describe it: one describes
 the relationship between the objects ("Is linked to" is
 the default, although you can modify the default using
 the LinkWorks Manager application), and one describes
 the destination of the link. The text describing the
 link type and the destination comes from information
 that was specified or used by default when the link was
 made.

 You can edit the description of the relationship and
 the destination by clicking on the Show Link... button
 and editing the appropriate information in the dialog
 box that appears.

 A right arrow (->) on a link line means that the
 selected object is the source and the described
 object is the target. A left arrow (<-) on a link line
 means that the selected object is the target and the
 described object is the source.

=INCLUDE LinkWorks menu
=KEYWORD tutorial
 This short, step-by-step tutorial will get you started
 using LinkWorks features. Keep the help window open,
 and perform the following steps in the appropriate
 window of the application you are using.

 1. Select an object in the application that you are
    currently using. ("Select" usually means to click on
    the object.)

    For example:

    -   In Bookreader, select a topic in the Contents.
        (If you don't have a book open, open one and
        make sure its Contents is in the Bookreader
        navigation window.)

    -   In Calendar, select a timeslot from a day
        display. (Pick a timeslot that has information
        entered in it. If you have no timeslots with
        entries, pick two timeslots on two different
        days and enter some information in each; then go
        back and select the first timeslot.)

    -   In Cardfiler, select a card.

    -   In Mail, select a message from your Mail
        folder.

 2. Pull down the Link menu.

 3. Choose the Start Link menu item.

 4. Select another object in the application that you
    are currently using.

    For example:

    -   In Bookreader, select another topic in the
        Contents.

    -   In Calendar, select a timeslot (that already has
        an entry in it) from a different day.
 

    -   In Cardfiler, select another card.

    -   In Mail, select another message from your Mail
        folder.

    (You can go to another hyperapplication and select
    one of its objects. However, for the sake of
    simplicity, we suggest that beginners select an
    object from the same hyperapplication.)

 5. Pull down the Link menu again.

 6. Choose the Complete Link menu item.

    This creates the link.

    You can choose Complete Link... instead of Complete
    Link if you want to see a dialog box in which you
    can edit some of the information about the link. If
    you choose the Complete Link... item, click on OK to
    create the link.

 7. With the second object still selected and visible,
    pull down the Link menu again.

 8. Choose the Visit menu item.

    The linked object (that is, the one you selected in
    step 1) should now be displayed.

    If you wish, perform the last two steps again,
    but this time select and display the first object
    (the one you used for step 1) and then visit the
    object to which it is linked. This action shows that
    links can be followed in either direction (source to
    target or target to source).

 As you can see, it is easy to make and follow
 information links.

 As you gain experience with hyperapplication features,
 you may want to perform more powerful and sophisticated
 operations. To learn more about LinkWorks:

 1. Explore the help topics and additional topics that
    you see for the Link menu.
 

 2. Read the chapter about using hyperapplications. For
    VMS DECwindows Motif users, this chapter appears
    in the VMS DECwindows Motif User's Guide; for other
    users, this chapter appears in the LinkWorks User's
    Guide.

 3. After you are comfortable with basic
    hyperapplication features, use the LinkWorks Manager
    application to perform more advanced operations.

    Read the chapter on using the LinkWorks Manager.
    For VMS DECwindows Motif users, this chapter appears

 For any link, one object must be the source and the
 other must be the target. The LinkWorks behavior is
 not affected by which object is the source and which is
 the target: you can select either a source or a target
 and perform a Go To or Visit operation to arrive at
 its destination. You can establish personal or group
 guidelines for designating sources and targets.

 When you select an object and use the Start Link menu
 item, that object is automatically made the source of
 the link you are creating.

 Select an object for a link just as you would to
 perform any other operation, such as to copy or delete
 it. Each hyperapplication determines which of its
 objects are linkable objects (that is, which objects
 can be used in links). See the documentation for each
 hyperapplication for a listing of its linkable objects.

 To link two objects:

 1. Select an object to be the source for the link.

    For any link, one object must be the source and
    the other must be the target. It does not matter
    which object is the source or target: you can select
    either a source or a target and perform a Go To or
    Visit operation to view its its destination.

 2. Choose the Start Link menu item.

 3. Select another object in the same hyperapplication
    or in a different one.

 4. Choose the Complete Link or Complete Link... menu
    item.

    Complete Link creates the link using default
    information.

    Complete Link... displays a dialog box in which you
    can edit some attributes of the link. You can also
    specify the Retain This Source option. Click on OK
    to create the link.

 The new link is added to the recording linknet. See the

=TITLE Hyperinformation Background and Concepts
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU
 Until now, there has been no way to create links
 between related pieces of information that are in
 different databases. The only links between pieces
 of information were the ones that you could remember.

 The Link menu in hyperapplications resolves this
 problem by providing the ability to record these
 (previously mental) links in their own database, so
 that you don't need to worry about remembering them.

 The topics listed below provide some background to this
 new technology.
 

4  history
=TITLE history
=TITLE History: Vannevar Bush and his Memex Machine
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU
 The term hypertext was coined by Ted Nelson, a computer
 visionary, back in the 1960s, but it was inspired by
 the dream of Vannevar Bush, the scientific adviser to
 President Franklin D. Roosevelt, even further back
 in the 1940s. The problem was an overabundance of
 information.

 Bush was struck by the increasing volume of
 documentation, particularly in the scientific world.
 Here the problem was particularly acute, because of the
 need to be able to sift through and utilize existing
 research. He saw that we were rapidly approaching
 an information overload situation, where the amount
 of time it took to do a thorough search for related
 information would become prohibitive. His concern was
 not that too much data was being produced, but rather
 that its usefulness was hampered by a lack of tools
 and references to lead to the relevant information.
 But Bush proposed a solution: the memex (for "memory
 extender").

 The information overload that Bush saw has grown, as
 has our need for a "memex." Fortunately, at the same
 time, computers have become sufficiently powerful to
 provide a solution.
 

5  memex
=TITLE memex
=TITLE Bush's Memex
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background hypertext
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background history
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU
 Bush's memex was a hypothetical engine that provided
 quick access to a microfilm library, on which all
 of your books, pictures, periodicals, and newspapers
 would be recorded. A keyboard and scanner would also
 record personal ideas and materials onto microfilm for
 inclusion with the library of information.

 To consult a book, you simply entered a code and the
 book would be represented on the screen. The book
 could then be read or skimmed at will. Margin notes
 or comments could be added to the book, and other books
 could be accessed and consulted at the same time, by
 using a reference in the index and having it projected
 onto adjacent screens.

 Bush stated that you could then build associations
 between two books on adjacent screens, just by pressing
 a button. Whenever either reference was accessed in
 the future, the other could be accessed at the touch
 of a button. Thus, one could establish links between
 related pieces of information and store these links
 permanently.

 Paths could be built, from document to document, and
 the effect would be as if you had created a new book,
 using sections from existing documents. What is more,
 these linking paths could be given to other people,
 who would then not need to repeat the tedious discovery
 process that you had already gone through.
 

4  hypertext
=TITLE hypertext
=TITLE HyperText: the Classical Solution
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background hyperinformation
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU
 A linear (non-hypertext) document can only be read
 easily in the order in which the text flows in the
 book. An essential advantage of non-linear text is
 the ability to organize text in different ways to
 accommodate differing viewpoints.

 The first major break from this linear tradition
 was provided by Ted Nelson's hypertext in the early
 1960s. Because of inadequacies in the technology at
 that time, the hypertext systems that were developed
 were mostly just prototypes, and those that did
 become commercial products sold to only a handful of
 specialized customers. Nevertheless, hypertext was a
 great step toward fulfilling Vannevar Bush's dream.

 Hypertext links can connect "related thoughts" to
 the body of the text, so that they can be accessed
 instantly by anyone who wants to see them. You are not
 forced to return to the source, and you may be able to
 follow links in the newly accessed text.
 

5  hypertext_limitations
=TITLE hypertext_limitations
=TITLE Hypertext Limitations
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background hypertext
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background hyperinformation
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU
 Hypertext has two fundamental limitations: it is
 document-based and it is isolated.

 Being document-based means that the links only apply to
 text files of one type or another. But what if you want
 to link a picture, or a spreadsheet?

 Being isolated means that it applies only to documents
 that have been brought into the system. This process is
 a source of several problems. You have to do something
 to every document to get it into the system, which
 means that you then have two copies - one in the
 hypertext storage file, and the original. This wastes
 space; but more seriously, if the original is modified
 in any way, your hypertext copy is out-of-date.

 So, you are limited both by what you are allowed to
 store (file types) and by what you might wish to store
 (files which are likely to be edited). Hyperinformation
 solves both these problems.
 

4  hyperinformation
=TITLE hyperinformation
=TITLE Hyperinformation: the Boundless Solution
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background connections
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU
 A motto for hyperinformation might be: "If it's on
 the network, it can be part of your hyperinformation
 environment." A hyperinformation environment is a
 partnership among participating applications, the
 application data, and the underlying hyperinformation
 service routines. The service routines maintain and
 track information in application databases, are thus
 perfectly placed to embrace any new hypermedia -
 graphics, digitized speech, audio recordings, pictures,
 or animation sequences.

 Hyperinformation is not a new type of hypertext
 database with additional features; it is a capability,
 a powerful additional way to manipulate existing
 (or future) information. It allows all existing
 databases to be treated as if they were combined into
 one enormous pool of information. Hyperinformation
 merely provides new ways for the user to access this
 information.

 The hyperinformation environment may thus be thought of
 as the accumulation of all the information in all the
 databases connected by the communication network to a
 personal work system. Because it is potentially vast
 and perpetually expanding, it is by nature boundless.
 

4  connections
=TITLE connections
=TITLE Who Creates the Links?
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background networks
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU
 The most useful, powerful links will undoubtedly be
 ones that you have created yourself. These links will
 certainly include those that require human insight and
 understanding of the deeper meaning of information.
 They are also likely to be the links that are most
 important to your work.

 There are likely to be two further sources of links,
 which together will comprise perhaps 80 - 95% of all
 the links that you will use. These might be supplied
 with data - documents and databases, for example - or
 they might be created by other people in your working
 environment.

 Links supplied with data would include those created,
 for example, by the author of a document.

 Links created by your friends and your colleagues
 are likely to be some of the more important ones.
 For example, if a group of people were reviewing a
 document, each reviewer is likely to link his or her
 own remarks to the original document.

=TITLE networks
=TITLE Why Complicate the Issue with Linknets?
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background connections
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background paths
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU
 Creating links in linknets is similar to creating files
 in a directory. When you have only a few files, it
 makes sense to have them all in one directory: you
 don't even need to know about directories.

 But when you have many files, directories become useful
 for separating files into meaningful groups. Thus, it
 is only when you start to define many links that you
 will need to think about using more than one personal
 linknet and about changing recording from one linknet
 to another.

 You must use the LinkWorks Manager application to
 create and manipulate linknets.
 

4  paths
=TITLE paths
=TITLE What's a Path?
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU background
=INCLUDE LinkWorks MENU
 Whenever you follow a link or a step in a path, these
 navigation steps are recorded in a history list. This
 history list is volatile; so when you end your session
 or exit the LinkWorks Manager, the history information
 is lost. However, you can make a permanent recording of
 your navigation steps in a path.

 Thus, a path consists of a series of steps. A step is
 made by using a Go To or Visit operation to follow a
 link from its source to its target or from its target
 to its source.

 You must use the LinkWorks Manager application to
 create and manipulate paths.

 The Go To and Visit menu items follow the link of the
 selected object. If the object has several links, a
 dialog box is displayed from which you can select a
 specific link.

 Go To differs from Visit only in that Go To closes the
 window that displays the current object and opens a
 new one to display the destination information. Visit
 leaves the current object window displayed.

 Go To is useful for preventing screen clutter because
 it closes windows as you follow links. Visit is
 useful for comparing two objects and for maintaining
 continuity when you know you want to return to your
 present situation after examining the destination
 object.

 The Complete Link menu item creates a new link using
 default information and adds the link to the recording
 linknet. The object you selected before choosing
 Complete Link is made the target for the link.

 You can change some of the default information for
 links with the LinkWorks Manager application.

 Contrast with Complete Link..., which displays a dialog
 box in which you can edit the properties of the source,
 target, and link, and in which you can specify the
 Retain This Source option.

 The Complete Link... menu item creates a new link
 and adds it to the recording linknet. The object you
 selected before choosing Complete Link... is made the
 target for the link.

 A dialog box is displayed that lets you edit the
 properties of the source, target, and link and that
 lets you specify the Retain This Source option.

 Contrast with Complete Link, which does not display a
 dialog box and uses default information to create the
 link.

 You can change some of the default information for
 links by using the LinkWorks Manager application.

 Highlighting refers to making visible the fact that
 objects are linked. If highlighting is enabled, linked
 objects are highlighted in a manner that is appropriate
 to the hyperapplication. (The hyperapplication's
 documentation explains the technique used.)

 If highlighting is disabled, you cannot see which
 objects are linked. (The links still exist and can
 be followed.) You may want to disable highlighting
 if there are many links and you are not interested in
 following them at this time.

 To enable and disable highlighting, use the Turn
 Highlight On/Off item from the Link menu. This
 item says Turn Highlight On if highlighting is
 currently disabled, and it says Turn Highlight Off
 if highlighting is currently enabled.

 To specify which types of objects to highlight when
 highlighting is enabled, use the Highlight... menu
 item. A Highlight dialog box is displayed.
