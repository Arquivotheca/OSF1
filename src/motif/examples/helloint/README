This directory contains the sample UIL/Xm program hellomotif,
a simple program with a label and a push button.

With this version, you can choose a kanji, hebrew, french,
or english interface at run time. 

To locate the UID files, the demo is using the $UIDPATH environment
variable, which requires you to set $XAPPLRESDIR to ., and the $LANG
or the xnlLanguage resource to one of the following:

	$LANG		Type of Interface
	-----		-----------------
	japan		kanji interface 
	hebrew		hebrew interface 
	french		a french interface
	english		standard english interface

(use *xnlLanguage:$LANG	in your .Xdefaults if your shell doesn't let you
set $LANG directly).

The fonts needed for the demos are:

    french: -adobe-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-p-67-iso8859-1
    english: -adobe-times-medium-r-normal--14-100-100-100-p-74-iso8859-1
    hebrew: -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--13-120-75-75-C-80-ISO8859-8
    japan: -*-JISX0208.1983-1
       &   -*-JISX0201.1976-0

If you don't have those fonts installed on your system, you can either
change the uil files to reference other fonts or install the
fonts provided in ./bdf for your server (using bdftosnf, bdftopcs or
whatever font compiler your X server is using).
