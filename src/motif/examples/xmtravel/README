xmtravel is a simple front-end to an travel agent client and flight 
database.  The program is designed to illustrate various user-interface
design concepts as well as be OSF/Motif Style Guide compliant.  
Many of the functions in the program are hardcoded to look like they work, 
while they really don't.  Other functions do nothing; they are there for 
appearance sake only.

XMtravel is the application default resource file for xmtravel.
It may be loaded in using the command:

   % xrdb -m XMtravel.ad

It also installed into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.

                     Enjoy
