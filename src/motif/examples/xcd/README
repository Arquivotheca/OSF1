	XCD - X Compact Disk Player.
	============================


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

NOTE: THIS PROGRAM IS NOT SUPPORTED. IT IS PROVIDED AS AN EXAMPLE PROGRAM.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


How to build this program:


    Copy the source code into a directory.

    In that directory:

	#   xmkmf
	#   make

	This should build the executable.

	If you have superuser permissions:

	#   make install

	will install the program and its other files.


Installation if not superuser.

    Copy the executable 'xcd' to some place in your path. 

    You will need to copy the Applications Defaults file Xcd.ad into
    a place that xcd will find it. If you have permissions, copy the
    file into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Xcd otherwise copy it into
    your home directory as 'Xcd'

	cp Xcd.ad /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Xcd

	    - or -

	cp Xcd.ad $HOME/Xcd

The CD device:

    Xcd will now attempt to find the cd player on your machine. If
    you have multiple CD-ROM players on your machine, it will use
    the first one found. The method it uses is to start scanning
    the bus using CAM from low to high, so the lowest numbered CD-ROM
    on the lowest numbered bus will be the selected device. To 
    override this selection, set the environment variable CDROM or
    the '-f' option which will override this mechanism.

    You will need to have the permissions of your CD ROM changed to 
    allow proper operation. In our example we will use /dev/rrz4c. 
    As superuser you should:

	# chmod 666 /dev/rrz4c


    You can tell xcd where the CD ROM drive is.  You can do this
    by either setting the environment variable CDROM to the device,
    or by starting xcd with the -cd option.
    For example:

	# using the environment variable
	csh> setenv CDROM /dev/rrz4c
	csh> xcd

	# using the '-cd' option
	csh> xcd -cd /dev/rrz4c

    Or you can let xcd figure out where the CD-ROM is.


	Front panel buttons:
	--------------------

	Most of the buttons on the control panel are self-explanatory.
	One, however, may not be obvious.  The padlock button may be used
	to disable the eject button on the front of the RRD42.  This can
	be used to prevent someone from ripping off your CD.


	Insert a disk:
	--------------

	You should have the CD you want to listen to inserted in the
	drive before starting the xcd application.  If you do not, xcd 
	will take a few minutes to come up and you may get some error 
	messages.  It is safe to ignore these messages if you get them.


CUSTOMIZATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	You may control some aspects of xcd's appearance by specifying
	xcd resources in your ~/.Xdefaults file.  Use the file "Xcd" as 
	a template.  In the binary kit, this file is found at :

		/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Xcd

	If you have the source kit, a motif UIL compiler, and a little 
	iniative, you can do a quite a bit of customization of xcd by 
	monkeying with the UIL file.  Most notable are customizations 
	of the number of "select" buttons/row, button size, and the 
	startup volume level.  See the makefile rule for "xcd.uid" 
	to see how to compile the UIL file.


Have fun!
