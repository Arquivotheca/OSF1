README for The Periodic Table of Motif Widgets


			       PERIODIC v2.0
			       -------------

	This directory contains the sources for periodic.  Periodic is a
	demo of the displayable widgets in Motif.  Periodic presents many
	Motif widgets for your visual and sensual enjoyment.

	The resources in the file Periodic.ad should be used. Either
	merge the file with your .Xdefaults, or copy it to your
	home directory and rename it to 'Periodic' - it will then be
	used as the application defaults file.

	Ignore the color resources if you are displaying on a monochrome
	server. If the fonts do not exist on your server, change the
	resource to use a font of similar size.

	This is a rewrite of the previous version that was shipped with
	earlier releases of Motif.  The original version of Periodic can
	be found in ../../tests/Performance/Expose/.

	Enjoy,

	Michael K. Yee
