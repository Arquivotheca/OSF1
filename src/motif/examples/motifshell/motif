      On December 30, 1988 OSF announced that the user environment component
   offering will be based on several leading technologies: Digital Equipment
   Corporation's toolkit technology (widgets) and the joint Hewlett-Packard/
   Microsoft submission of H-P's 3-D appearance and Microsoft's Presentation
   Manager-compatable behavior (window manager).  The hybrid offering, OSF/
   Motif environment will provide users with a familiar way to access computer
   resources across a broad variety of computing hardware platforms, from
   personal computers to mainframes.

      In developing the first release of its user environment component, OSF
   reviewed (and continues to solicit) the best available technologies from the 
   industry through its innovative open process, the Request For Technology (RFT).   
   Twenty-three of forty RFT submissions met the OSF's criteria for a user
   environment component or graphical user interface.  OSF plans to use the RFT
   process for other offerings in the future.

      The first snapshot release of OSF/Motif was made available to licensed
   members at the end of January.  Licensed programs and Documentation include:
