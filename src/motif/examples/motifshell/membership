     OSF membership is open to everyone: end users, computer   
  hardware and software suppliers, educational institutions,   
  government agencies, organizations around the world.  Members   
  contribute ideas on both technical and policy matters, and 
  are informed of foundation activities on a regular basis.

    Members receive early and equal access to OSF specifications  
  and code, allowing them to streamline the integration of OSF   
  technology into their business.  OSF offerings to members include   
  subscriptions for foundation newsletters, and "snapshots" of 
  specifications and source code during development.
