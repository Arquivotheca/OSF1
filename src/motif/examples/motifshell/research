     The OSF Research Institute is OSF's effort to increase the rate at   
  which laboratory innovations become products.  The Research Institute   
  provides a vital link between OSF, university  and commercial labs,    
  internationally.  OSF will devote ten percent of its operating budget   
  to support interaction with the research community.

     The institute will act as a clearing house and focal point for     
  operating system and specification extensions and enhancements on a   
  worldwide basis.  The work of the institute will have a far-reaching   
  impact on the design and use of computer systems well into the 1990s.
