This directory includes files for Motif toolkit example programs:

		README		- this file

		XMdemos.ad		- app-defaults for example programs

		xmdialogs.c	- dialog sampler

                xmfonts.c       - font browser

		xmeditor.c	- text editor

		xmlist.c	- list example

		xmprotocol.c	- window manager protocols example

		xmter.c		- shape & animation example

		xmform.c	- form attachment example

		xmforc.c	- form attachment + rowcolumn example

		xmmap.c		- drawingarea + scrolledwindow example

		xmgetres.c	- resource fetching example

		xmapdef.c	- app defined scrolled window example



	NOTES:
 
	1)	XMdemos.ad MUST be put in the app-defaults area before the
		xmdialogs demo will work.  The file should be named XMdemos.
                Usually the app-defaults area is /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.
                The demo will run without the defaults, but the buttons for
                creating and managing the dialogs will not appear.   Make
                install will correctly place the defaults file.

	2)	The xmfonts demo defaults to displaying the fonts whose
		name length are less than 10 characters. On some systems, 
		the font path contains only long XLFD font names. It may be 
		necessary either to set the resource xmfonts*maxLen to a
		bigger number (80), and to specify a numColumns resource
		of 1, or to add a fonts.alias file with the reserved keyword 
		FILE_NAMES_ALIASES in your font directory.

	3)	For xmter, you'll have to tell your favorite non-motif
	        window-manager to remove all the window decorations.
		For mwm, it's already done by the program itself.

	4)	xmform displays a string made of Motif widgets
	        embedded in a Form. The syntax is xmform <string> or
	        xmform alone (which display the string "MOTIF").
                The only letters available in this version are the
                letter F,I,M,O,T. Feel free to implement other letters and
		to send them to the OSF as enhancement.

	5)      xmgetres is a example of how to use XmGetSecondaryResourceData.
		the syntax is xmgetres <WidgetClass> or xmgetres alone
		(which display the resources for "Widget").
		You can also use "xmgetres All" which displays the
		resouces for all the Xt + the Motif widgets.

If you notice any bugs in these demos, please see the bug list in
the Release Notes to see if the problem is a known Toolkit defect.
