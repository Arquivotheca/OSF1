  .SH SYNOPSIS

  .SH DESCRIPTION
  .PP
  The \fIxauth\fP program is used to edit and display the authorization 
  information used in connecting to the X server.  This program is usually
! to extract authorization records from one machine and merge them in on 
! another (as is the case when using remote logins or to grant access to
  other users).  Commands (described below) may be entered interactively,
  on the \fIxauth\fP command line, or in scripts.  Note that this program
  does \fBnot\fP contact the X server.
  .SH OPTIONS
  The following options may be used with \fIxauth\fP.  They may be given 
! individually (e.g. \fI\-q \-i\fP) or may combined (e.g. \fI-qi\fP):
