I'm sending out 4 patch files to be applied to the PEXlib sources.

5 new functions have been added to the library...

PEXEncodeOCs
PEXDecodeOCs
PEXGetSizeOCs
PEXCountOCs
PEXFreeOCData

2 new .c files were added to the sources (pl_oc_enc.c and pl_oc_dec.c),
so make sure you do a "make depend".

In addition, a few bugs were fixed...

- PEXSetOfFillAreaSet was not processing the connectivity data correctly.

- For PSC level curves, the parameters are now a list of floats, rather
  than a list of coords.

- PEXSendOCs was fixed to take the number of bytes, rather than the
  number of words in the buffer.

- In PEXGetPickMeasure, there was a bug in unpacking the pick measure status.

- PEXNoop was broken (believe it or not).


Also, a few function prototypes have changed...

- PEXGetTableInfo now has a return argument for the table info,
  instead of a return value.

- PEXEscapeWithReply no longer returns an escape ID.


There were numerous other changes made, but they were mostly trivial
name changes internal to PEXlib, so I won't go into them.

In last week's pex-client meeting, we decided to make some more changes to
the api (concerning return values and status).  This patch DOES NOT CONTAIN
those changes, since the changes are not fully defined at this point.

The next thing I will be working on is the PEXlib utility functions.  My
guess is that it will be ready 2-3 weeks from now.

You should get 4 patch files following this message.
