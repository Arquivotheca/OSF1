Please Reject bug #4912. I have discussed this with USL, and the change was 
intentional. Moving X_TLI_STREAM to the end of the array makes it easier
to support multiple TLI based transports.

Although binary compatability will not be completely maintained, making the
change as requested by bug #4912 would add extra complexity to the rest of
the code, and therefore is not worth the effort involved.

A reasonable workaround is to use LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the matching
Xlib that the older X Server was built with (ie. /usr/lib/X11R3/libX11.so.1).
