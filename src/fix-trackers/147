### bug number:   4880
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     

DESCRIPTION:
    It appears that the subwindow field in the EnterWindow event is not being
    filled in when a Grabpointer request is made and the pointer is contained
    in a child window of the grab window.

The protocol makes it clear that the subwindow field is supposed to be set to
None.  Not as useful, but more correct.
