        Subject: RS/6000 Editres problems
        ### bug number:   4731
        ### area:         editres
        ### severity:     low
        ### comments:     since it works with Xaw/core clients is this our bug?

Inconclusive, probably some subtlity with building Motif library since
there is no problems with Xaw.  Cannot investigate further without
Motif 1.1.3 source.

As I wrote before, yes I am talking about a privately built Motif - now 1.1.4.
I am not sure whether your hint about duplicate symbols in Xmu vs. Xt is right,
but it lead me to change my build method.

What I did before was to add most of Xt in my Motif library. What I ended up
doing was to add in the Xmu as well. (I.e. take the Xt/*.o and Xmu/*.o files
and include them in the "ar cq ..." command.)

This made things work nicely.
