### bug number:   5237
### area:         server
### severity:     low
### comments:     rejected

Rejected, this is not a bug.  Contents for background None come from the screen
only "if the contents come from the parent of the window or an inferior of the
parent; otherwise, the initial contents ... are undefined."  In the example
given, the client window is resized before the twm frame, so contents would
be coming from the root window, which is not the parent nor an inferior, so
the contents are undefined.
