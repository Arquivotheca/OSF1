I've fixed cfb so that it can be included multiple times to support multiple
bits-per-pixel values in the same server; even on the screen simultaneously.

Additionally, cfb also handles multiple depths with the same bpp and different
sets of visual types.  As a side effect, several outstanding cfb bugs have been
fixed.

As usual, the fixes are huge, so they'll be sent out in three messages
following this one.
