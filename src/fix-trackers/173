Please note that in a few places added code is commented out.
Please check these additions carefully. This commented code was
provided for completeness, but is commented since until more
ddpex code is put in place these calls will not work properly
since structures they rely on have not been filled in since
the ddpex code responsible for that work is still under 
construction.
