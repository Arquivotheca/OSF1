        Subject: Xlib prototypes promote unsigned char incorrectly
        ### bug number:   2576
        ### area:         Xlib
        ### severity:     low

This bug report complained that the Xlib prototypes were inconsistent
with ANSI C default integral promotions.  This is not a bug.

It is the intent of the Xlib prototypes to be compatible with K&R C
so that programs compiled with either a K&R or an ANSI compiler will
work together.
