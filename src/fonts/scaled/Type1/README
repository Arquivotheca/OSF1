This directory contains a "Type 1" (PostScript) outline font, donated by
IBM, for the IBM Courier typeface.  (IBM Courier is a registered
trademark of IBM).  It requires that the Type 1 font rasterization code,
also donated by IBM, be linked into the X server and the font server (see
contrib/fonts/lib/font/Type1/README).

Other Type 1 outline fonts have been donated, notably the Utopia font
donated by Adobe Systems, Inc. The Adobe contribution includes both outlines
and bitmaps at certain specific sizes.  You will probably want to merge the
bitmaps into the existing bitmap font directories, and combine all Type
1 fonts into a single directory.  In anticipation of this, IBM has
donated some sample Imakefiles which include references to the Adobe
Utopia contribution (Imakefile, Imakefile.100dpi, Imakefile.75dpi).
