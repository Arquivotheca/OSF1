# HISTORY
#
This directory contains a rasterizer, donated by IBM, for "Type 1"
(PostScript) format outline fonts.  To be used, this rasterizer must be
bound into the X server and the font server.  It is more convenient to
do this if this directory is moved to the 'mit' side of the directory
tree (i.e., mit/font/lib/font/Type1, a peer of the 'Speedo' directory).
Of course, mit/font/lib/font/Imakefile must be made aware of its new
subdirectory and the objects in it.  If you keep this directory where it
it, you must insure that the library mit/font/lib/font/libfont.a
contains this code.
 
In addition, the rasterizer must be "registered" with X. The source in
mit/fonts/lib/font/fontfile/renderers.c, specifically the routine
FontFileRegisterFontFileFunctions(), must be modified to add the line:
 
    Type1RegisterFontFileFunctions();
 
after the call to "SpeedoRegisterFontFileFunctions".
 
Some Type 1 fonts have been donated; see, for example, the directory
contrib/fonts/scaled/Type1.  In order to use them, they must be in the
font path, either by combining them in some existing font object
directory, or adding a new font directory to the path.
