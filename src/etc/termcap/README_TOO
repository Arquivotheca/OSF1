# This README_TOO file is intended to describe the organization and contents of
# this source pool.
#
# Contents:
#	Termcap(4) files split up into sections by Manufacturer, and further
#	split by Support status.
#
# Origin of files in this directory:
#	The original master termcap file is termcap.src.  It came from
#	OSF as-is.  -r1.1 is the original OSF/1 R1.0 file.  Chunks are
#	created from the -r?.1 version of temcap.src for each release.
#
# Supported and Unsupported files:
#	Some files are Supported by Digital Equipment Corporation.  Others
#	are not.  See the "Makefile" file for further details.
