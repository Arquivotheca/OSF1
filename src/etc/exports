# HISTORY
# 
# @(#)$RCSfile: exports,v $ $Revision: 4.1.5.2 $ (DEC) $Date: 1993/12/10 00:29:51 $ 
#
# The exports file defines remote mount points for NFS mount requests.
#
# Syntax: pathname [-option ...] [name ...]
#
# A whitespace character in the left-most position of a line indicates
# a continuation line.
#
# pathname      Specifies the name of a local file system or directory
#               of a local filesystem.
#
# The following are valid exports options:
#
# -root=0
#         Maps all client superusers to uid 0; by default, superusers are
#         mapped to user "nobody".  This option overrides -anon=uid for
#         client superusers.
# -root=hostname[:hostname]...
#         Maps client superusers on only the specified hosts to uid 0;
#         overrides the use of -anon=uid for client superusers.
# -ro
#         Exports pathname read-only; default is read-write.
# -rw=hostname[:hostname]...
#         Exports pathname read-write to the specified hosts and
#         read-only to other hosts.
# -anon=uid
#         Maps anonymous users to the specified uid.  Client superusers
#         and NFS requests without UNIX authentication are considered
#         anonymous; setting uid to -1 disables anonymous access.
# -access=name[:name]...
#         Specifies the hosts to grant mount access to.  Use of
#         whitespace separated name list following options is also
#         accepted.  Client can be a host name, IP address, or NIS
#         netgroup.  If a mount access list is not provided, the path
#         is exported to all hosts.
