#
# STREAMS configuration file used by strsetup.
#
# Each line in this file specifies one or more character special files
# (or nodes) to be created when a STREAMS driver is configured in the kernel.  
# If the driver is not configured, the file does not created.  If an old 
# version of the file exists it is removed before the new one is created.
#
# The format of the file is as follows with each field being separated
# by one or more tabs or spaces:
#
#	field 1: the driver name.  This is the name of the driver
#		 as reported by "strsetup -c".  This field is
#		 used to match the names read from the kernel and
#		 must match exactly (the match is case sensative).
#	field 2: the filename.  This field specified the name of
#		 the character special file(s) which are to be created
#		 when the named driver is configured in the kernel.
#		 These should be full path names.  The filename may
#		 contain one conversion specifier in the style of printf(3).
#		 This conversion is used to include a minor device number
#		 in the filename.  The permitted conversions are:
#			%d, %x, %X, %o, %u, %i
#		 to print the minor number as a signed decimal, hex (with
#		 lower case letters), hex (with upper case letters),
#		 octal, unsigned decimal, or signed decimal number
#		 respectively. "%%" is used to include a percent sign
#		 in the filename.  Optionally, each of these conversions
#		 can include a specification for some number of leading 0's.
#		 This is done by following the % with a 0 and one or more
#		 digits specifying the total number of digits to be
#		 printed.  The 0 must appear after the %.  See printf(3)
#		 for more details.
#		 All directories in the path of the filename will be created
#		 if they do not already exist.
#	field 3: the file mode.  This is the mode (ALWAYS in octal) assigned
#		 to the file when it is created.  The file is always created
#		 as a character special file.
#	field 4: the minor device number field.  Strsetup reads the major
#		 device numbers from the kernel.  This field tell it how
#		 to assign minor device numbers.  This field can contain
#		 the one of the following:
#			clone: the word 'clone' (all lower case) indicating
#			       that the device is to be created as a clone
#			       device.  In this case the major number 
#			       becomes that of the special clone pseudodrive
#			       and the minor device number becomes the
#			       devices major number.
#			N:     where N is a decimal number.  Create a single
#			       device with the minor device number N.
#			M-N:   where M and N are decimal numbers.  Create
#			       M-N nodes with the devices major number and
#			       minor numbers between M and N.  When a range
#			       of minor numbers are specified a filename
#			       conversion specifier as described above (so that
#			       the minor numbers can be used to make each
#			       node created unique).
