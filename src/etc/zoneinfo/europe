# United Kingdom

# From Peter Ilieve (peter@memex.co.uk) (July 4, 1989)
#
# From the UK Government paper "Summer Time: A Consultation Document"
# (HMSO Cm722 June 1989), which is about the possibility of the UK moving
# into the central European timezone and synchronising its summer time with
# the rest of Europe (by moving the end date back a month to end Sep.,
# the start dates are already the same).
#
# Summer time was not observed before 1916.
# It was introduced in the First World War in response to its introduction
# by Germany in March 1916.
# During the Second World War normal summer time was used in Winter and double
# summer time was used in Summer.
# Between 1968 and 1971 GMT+1 was used all year as an experiment.
# This caused voluble objections in Scotland and the experiment was judged
# a failure.
#
# Although it does not say what happens in Europe, it does say that most
# of Europe did not use summer time until 1979, presumably dropping it
# after the 1st and/or 2nd war.
#
# Note that this is not necessarily accurate for Eire.
#
# The paper gives a complete record of dates from 1916, and dates up to 1992.
# The intention is to have the new system, if any, start in 1993.
# The dates are (copied exactly from the table in the paper):

# From Arthur David Olson (January 19, 1989):
#
# A source at the British Information Office in New York avers that it's
# known as "British" Summer Time in all parts of the United Kingdom.

# From an Anonymous U. K. Donor (January 4, 1989):
#
# It is NOT possible to predict when [British Summer Time] will change
# in a future year.
#
# (The admiralty calculate when they think it should be (no more that a couple
# of years in advance) and advise the government who then decide whether or
# not they will take the admiralty's advice)
#
# ...the Gre[e]nwich...observatory...[was] very helpful.
#
# I was not able to track down the Admiralty formula (I tried hard but failed)

# ...
# [British Summer Time] is fixed annually by Act of Parliament.
# If you can predict what Parliament will do, you should be in
# politics making a fortune, not computing.

# One source shows that Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, and Greece observe DST from

#
# ...the European time rules are...standardized since 1981, when
# most European coun[tr]ies started DST.  Before that year, only
# a few countries (UK, France, Italy) had DST, each according
# to own national rules.  In 1981, however, DST started on
# 'Apr firstSun', and not on 'Mar lastSun' as in the following
# years...
# But also since 1981 there are some more national exceptions
# than listed in 'europe': Switzerland, for example, joined DST
# one year later, Denmark ended DST on 'Oct 1' instead of 'Sep
# lastSun' in 1981---I don't know how they handle now.
#
# Finally, DST ist always from 'Apr 1' to 'Oct 1' in the
# Soviet Union (as far as I know).

#
# The information from Tom Hofmann is (as far as I know) not entirely correct.
# After a request from chongo at amdahl I tried to retrieve all information
# about DST in Europe.  I was able to find all from about 1969.
#
# ...standardization on DST in Europe started in about 1977 with switches on
# first Sunday in April and last Sunday in September...
# In 1981 UK joined Europe insofar that
# the starting day for both shifted to last Sunday in March.  And from 1982
# the whole of Europe used DST, with switch dates April 1 and October 1 in
# the Sov[i]et Union.  In 1985 the SU reverted to standard Europe[a]n switch
# dates...
#
# It should also be remembered that time-zones are not constants; e.g.
# Portugal switched in 1976 from MET (or CET) to WET with DST...
# Note also that though there were rules for switch dates not
# all countries abided to these dates, and many individual deviations
# occurred, though not since 1982 I believe.  Another note: it is always
# assumed that DST is 1 hour ahead of normal time, this need not be the
# case; at least in the Netherlands there have been times when DST was 2 hours
# in advance of normal time.
