    plumber.c - check malloc arena for coreleaks

	author: WJHansen, CMU/ITC
	(c) Copyright IBM Corporation, 1986

Uses the IDENTIFY version of malloc, which stores the return address in the 
header of each block.  

Produces a table showing a description of the set of blocks produced from each calling address.


	WARNING:  if an application does sbrk's of its own, the arena
	will be in multiple segments.  The code here only processes the last of these.
