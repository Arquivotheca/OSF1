SUN-SPOTS DIGEST         Thursday, 17 March 1988       Volume 6 : Issue 31

Date:    Wed, 2 Mar 88 14:50:26 PST
From:    Doug Moran <moran@ai.sri.com>
Subject: Program to determine console type

There have been several requests in this digest for programs to determine
the type of the console.  Below is a program that I wrote to produce an
identifying string (I start suntools in my .login file and use this pgm to
determine which arguments to use).

Caveat:  my cluster has only a few of these monitor types, so the pgm has
not been fully tested.

Note on coding style: the function wu_fbid is actually located in a local
library, accounting for what otherwise might appear to be a strange coding
style.
