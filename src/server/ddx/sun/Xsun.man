.TH XSUN 1 "Release 5" "X Version 11"
.SH NAME
Xsun, XsunMono \- Sun server for X Version 11
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Xsun
[ option ] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Xsun
is the server for Version 11 of the X window system on Sun hardware.
It will normally be started by the \fIxdm(1)\fP daemon or by a script
that runs the program \fIxinit(1)\fP.
.SH CONFIGURATIONS
.PP
.I Xsun
supports both color and monochrome screens.
.I XsunMono
is configured to support only monochrome screens,
for low-end systems with limited memory.
.PP
If a specific framebuffer device file isn't
specified on the command line with the \fI\-dev\fP switch, the server will look
for the following framebuffers (the \fIconstype(1)\fP program may be used
to tell which type of display is attached as the console):
.TP 8
.B /dev/bwtwo0
This monochrome display is available on Sun-3/50, Sun-3/75, Sun-3/140, 
Sun-3/260, and Sun-3/280 platforms with both the 1152x900 and 1600x1280 
screen sizes.
.TP 8
.B /dev/cgtwo0
This color display is available on 3/160C, 3/260C, and 4/260C platforms.
It may also be used as a monochrome-only display with the \fI-mono\fP switch.
.TP 8
.B /dev/cgthree0
This color display is available on both the Sun386i and SPARCstation 1 
platforms.
.TP 8
.B /dev/cgfour0
This display is available on Sun-3/60, Sun-3/110, and Sun-4/110 
platforms.  It provides both color and monochrome screens (numbered 0 and 1,
respectively by default) on the same
monitor by toggling between them whenever the mouse goes off the left or
right edges of the screen.
.TP 8
.B /dev/cgsix0
This color display is available on SPARCstation 1 platforms with the 
GX graphics accelerator (which is used by the server to make some operations
faster).
.PP
Finally, if no specific framebuffers are found,
the generic framebuffer interface \fI/dev/fb\fP is used.
.PP
Note that the server does not support the GP,  GP+,  or GP2 graphics
coprocessors.  On these platforms, the \fBcgtwo\fP framebuffer should be
used instead (either by creating it or specifying \fI-dev /dev/cgtwo0\fP
on the server command line).
.SH OPTIONS
In addition to the normal server options described in the \fIXserver(1)\fP
manual page, \fIXsun\fP accepts the following command line switches:
.TP 8
.B "\-ar1 \fImilliseconds\fP"
This option specifies amount of time in milliseconds before which a pressed
key should begin to autorepeat.
.TP 8
.B "\-ar2\fP \fImilliseconds\fP"
This option specifies the internal in milliseconds between autorepeats of
pressed keys.
.TP 8
.B \-mono
When used with the \fBcgtwo\fP, this option indicates that the server should
emulate a monochrome framebuffer instead of the normal color framebuffer.
When used with the \fBcgfour\fP, this option indicates that the monochrome
screen should be numbered 0 and the color screen numbered 1 (instead of the
other way around).
.TP 8
.B \-zaphod
This option disables switching between screens by sliding the mouse off the
left or right edges.  With this disabled, a window manager function must be 
used to switch between screens.
.TP 8
.B \-debug
This option indicates that the server is being run from a debugger,
and that it should \fBnot\fP
put its standard input,  output and error files into non-blocking mode.
.TP 8
.B "\-dev \fIfilename\fP"
This option specifies the name of the framebuffer device file to be used
instead of the built-in defaults described above.
.SH "USE WITH SUNWINDOWS OR NeWS"
.PP
The server can be run from outside 
.BR suntools ,
in which case it configures for all available displays (unless overridden
by
.B -dev
options).
Otherwise,  it can be run ``on top of'' either
.B suntools
or
.BR NeWS .
In this case,  it takes over the entire screen it was invoked from.
.PP
If you have multiple displays,  you can run
.B suntools
on both,  use
.B adjacentscreens
to move the mouse between them,
and then run
.I Xsun
on top of one of the desktops.
.B Adjacentscreens
will still be in effect,  so you can move between window systems
by sliding the mouse from one screen to another.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP 8
\fBXDEVICE\fP
If present,  and if no explicit
.B -dev
options are given,  specifies the (colon separated) list of display devices
to use.
.TP 8
\fBWINDOW_PARENT\fP
If present,  specifies the
.I /dev/win
file of the
.B suntools
desktop.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
X(1), Xserver(1), xdm(1), xinit(1)
.SH BUGS
The auto-configuration depends on there being appropriate
special files in the
.I /dev
directory for the framebuffers which are to be used.  Extra
entries can confuse the server.
For example,  the X/160C in fact has the hardware for a monochrome
.B bwtwo0
on the CPU board.  So if 
.I /dev
has a special file for
.IR /dev/bwtwo0 ,
the server will use it,  even though there is no monitor attached to the
monochrome framebuffer.
The server will appear to start,  but not to paint a cursor,  because the
cursor is on the monochrome frame buffer.  The solution is to remove the
.I /dev
entries for any device you don't have a monitor for.
.PP
There is a bug in pre-FCS operating systems for the Sun-4
which causes the server to crash driving a \fBcgtwo\fP.
.PP
There is a race condition that sometimes happens when running
``on top of'' NeWS.  The symptom is that parts of NeWS show through,
and that the keyboard is in a non-useful state.  There is no
simple work-around.
.PP
Colon separated devices names do not work.
