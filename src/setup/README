The command scripts for building OSF/1 Release 1.0 source trees are stored
here under the subdirectory corresponding to the platform you are building
for.  For the example platform MMAX (the Encore Multimax reference platform)
the following build scripts exist:

MMAX/setup.sh               This script builds the tools necessary to
                            compile the rest of the tree.  (This does
                            not include compiler tools).

MMAX/kernel.sh              This script builds the OSF/1 kernel.

MMAX/cmds.sh                This script builds the include files, libraries,
                            and commands in the tree. 

MMAX/host.sh                This script is read in by the other scripts to
                            set up the basic variables used by all of the
                            scripts on the native Encore platform (this
                            script is operating system dependent: it is a
                            copy of encore.sh.  For other platforms host.sh
                            should be a copy of the file named after the host
                            operating system).

MMAX/osf1.sh                This script is similar to host.sh.  After
                            you install, boot, and run your new OSF/1
                            operating system, you can use the osf1.sh
                            script rather than the encore.sh script.
                            ( Remove host.sh and osf1.sh will be used
                            automatically. )

MMAX/onecmd.sh              This script can be used to rebuild individual
                            pieces of the commands build (files, cmds,
                            libraries) for the target machine.

MMAX/onetools.sh            This script can be used to rebuild individual
                            tools built to run on the host machine by the
                            setup  script.

MMAX/install.sh             This script creates an installable image of the
                            target machines' root filesystem.

postinstall.sh              This script is used to install a binary system
                            after a build is completed.  ( This is the only
                            machine independent script in the setup directory.)

All of these scripts must be executed at the root of the source tree
(i.e. "/osf1/snap5/src").  They should be invoked as arguments to the
sh command.  For example, you would type

        cd /osf1/snap5/src
        sh -x setup/MMAX/setup.sh

to setup the proper environment.

In addition, the following log files exist that contain the output
from the execution of each of these scripts at OSF.

MMAX/setup.log
MMAX/kernel.log
MMAX/cmds.log

You should save the output of your "sh -x <script>" command in a log
file for comparison with the output logs provided for reference.
