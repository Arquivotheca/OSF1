.LP
When you receive these events,
their structure members are set as follows.
.LP
The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely identifies
it.
For example, when the X server reports a
.PN GraphicsExpose
event to a client application, it sends an
.PN XGraphicsExposeEvent
structure with the type member set to
.PN GraphicsExpose .
The display member is set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
The send_event member is set to
.PN True
if the event came from a
.PN SendEvent
protocol request.
The serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol
but expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.
.LP
These structures have the following common members:
window, root, subwindow, time, x, y, x_root, y_root, state, and same_screen.
The window member is set to the window on which the
event was generated and is referred to as the event window. 
As long as the conditions previously discussed are met,
this is the window used by the X server to report the event.
The root member is set to the source window's root window.
The x_root and y_root members are set to the pointer's coordinates
relative to the root window's origin at the time of the event.
.LP
The same_screen member is set to indicate whether the event 
window is on the same screen
as the root window and can be either
.PN True 
or
.PN False .
If
.PN True ,
the event and root windows are on the same screen.
If
.PN False ,
the event and root windows are not on the same screen.
.LP
If the source window is an inferior of the event window, 
the subwindow member of the structure is set to the child of the event window
that is the source window or the child of the event window that is
an ancestor of the source window.
Otherwise, the X server sets the subwindow member to
.PN None .
The time member is set to the time when the event was generated 
and is expressed in milliseconds.
.LP
If the event window is on the same screen as the root window, 
the x and y members
are set to the coordinates relative to the event window's origin.
Otherwise, these members are set to zero.
.LP
The state member is set to indicate the logical state of the pointer buttons 
and modifier keys just prior to the event,
which is the bitwise inclusive OR of one or more of the
button or modifier key masks:
.PN Button1Mask ,
.PN Button2Mask ,
.PN Button3Mask ,
.PN Button4Mask ,
.PN Button5Mask ,
.PN ShiftMask ,
.PN LockMask ,
.PN ControlMask ,
.PN Mod1Mask ,
.PN Mod2Mask ,
.PN Mod3Mask ,
.PN Mod4Mask ,
and
.PN Mod5Mask .
.LP
Each of these structures also has a member that indicates the detail.
For the
.PN XKeyPressedEvent
and
.PN XKeyReleasedEvent
structures, this member is called keycode.
It is set to a number that represents a physical key on the keyboard.
The keycode is an arbitrary representation for any key on the keyboard
(see sections 12.7 and 16.1).
.LP
For the
.PN XButtonPressedEvent
and
.PN XButtonReleasedEvent
structures, this member is called button.
It represents the pointer button that changed state and can be the
.PN Button1 ,
.PN Button2 ,
.PN Button3 ,
.PN Button4 ,
or
.PN Button5 
value.
For the
.PN XPointerMovedEvent
structure, this member is called is_hint.
It can be set to 
.PN NotifyNormal
or
.PN NotifyHint .
