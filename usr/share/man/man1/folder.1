.SH DESCRIPTION
.iX "folder command"
.iX "Setting current folder"
.PP
The \*Lfolder\*O command lets you set the current folder,
or display information about it.
It can also be used to manage the folder stack.
.PP
If you use the \*Lfolder\*O command without a
\*V+folder\*O
argument, information about the current folder
is displayed on the screen.
If you use \*Lfolder\*O with the
\*V+folder\*O
argument, the named folder
is set to be the current folder.
Information about the named folder
is also displayed on the screen.
.PP
If you use \*Lfolder\*O with the
\*Vmsg\*O
argument, it will set the specified message to be current.
Information on the current folder is also displayed.
You can use both the
\*V+folder\*O
and
\*Vmsg\*O
arguments together in one command.
.PP
If you specify a
\*V+folder\*O
that does not exist, you are asked
whether you want to create it.
This is a good way to create an empty folder for later use.
.PP
The display is identical whether you set the folder
or display the contents of the current folder.
The following example shows the type of display that is produced.
The display lists the current folder,
the number of messages in it,
the range of the messages (low-high),
and the current message within the folder.
It also flags extra files if they exist.
.oS
inbox+ has   16 messages (   3-  22); cur=  15.
.oE
.\"
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SH FLAGS
.PP
.IP "\-all" 10
Displays information on all the folders in your Mail directory.
The folders are listed alphabetically,
with a line of information given for each folder.
This is identical to the display produced by the \*Lfolders\*O command.
See \*Lfolders\*O(1).
.\"
.IP "\-fast" 10
.PD 0
.IP "\-nofast"
.PD
Lists only the name of the current folder,
with no additional information.
This is faster because the folders need not be read.
.\"
.IP "\-header" 10
.PD 0
.IP "\-noheader" 10
.PD
Displays a header produced by the system,
in addition to the information about the current file.
This header is identical to the one that appears
at the top of the listing produced by \*Lfolder -all\*O or
by \*Lfolders\*O.  The header can be suppressed by using the
.B \-noheader
option.
.\"
.IP "\-help" 10
Prints a list of the valid options to this command.
.\"
.IP "\-list" 10
.PD 0
.IP "\-nolist" 10
.PD
Lists the contents of the folder-stack.
No
\*V+folder\*O
argument is allowed with this option.
The contents of the folder-stack are listed automatically
when the
.B \-pop
or
.B \-push
option is used.
This corresponds to the \*Ldirs\*O operation in the C-shell.
.\"
.IP "\-pack" 10
.PD 0
.IP "\-nopack"
.PD
Re-numbers messages in the folder.
Messages are re-numbered sequentially,
and any gaps in the numbering are removed.
The default operation is
\f3\-nopack\f1,
which does not change the numbering in the folder.
.\"
.IP "\-pop" 10
Discards the top of the folder-stack,
after setting the current folder to that value.
No
\*V+folder\*O
argument is allowed with this option.
This corresponds to the \*Lpopd\*O operation in the C-shell;
see \*Lcsh\*O(1). The
.B \-push
and
.B \-pop
options are mutually exclusive:
the last occurrence of either one overrides
any previous occurrence of the other.
.\"
.\"
.\" *** -print option commented out
.\" *** no information on it at this time
.ig
.IP "\-print" 10
.PD 0
.IP "\-noprint" 10
.PD
..
.\"
.IP "\-push" 10
Pushes the current folder onto the folder-stack,
and makes the
\*V+folder\*O
argument into the current folder.
If
\*V+folder\*O
is not given, the current folder
and the top of the folder-stack are exchanged.
This corresponds to the \*Lpushd\*O operation in the C-shell;
see \*Lcsh\*O(1).  The
.B \-push
switch and the
.B \-pop
switch are mutually exclusive:
the last occurrence of either one overrides any previous occurrence of the
other.
.\"
.IP "\-recurse" 10
.PD 0
.IP "\-norecurse" 10
.PD
Lists each folder recursively.
Information on the current folder is displayed,
followed by information on any sub-folders which it contains.
.\"
.IP "\-total" 10
.PD 0
.IP "\-nototal" 10
.PD
Displays only the total number of messages and folders
in your Mail directory.
This option does not print any information about the current folder.
It can be suppressed using the
.B \-nototal
option.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following example shows how \*Lfolder\*O can be used to change
the current folder to \*L+test\*O,
and display information on that folder.
The plus sign (\*L+\*O) next to \*Ltest\*O indicates that it is now
the current folder.
.oS
% \f(CBfolder +test\f(CW
                  test+ has    2 messages (   1-   2); cur=   2.
.oE
.PP
The next example shows the display produced by using the
.B "\-all"
option to \*Lfolder\*O:
.oS
  Folder      # of messages (  range  ); cur  msg  (other files)
    V2.3  has    3 messages (   1-   3).
  adrian  has   20 messages (   1-  20); cur=   2.
   brian  has   16 messages (   1-  16).
   chris  has   12 messages (   1-  12).
 copylog  has  242 messages (   1- 242); cur= 225.
   inbox+ has   73 messages (   1- 127); cur= 127.
     int  has    4 messages (   1-   4); cur=   2  (others).
    jack  has   17 messages (   1-  17); cur=  17.


             TOTAL= 387 messages in 8 folders.
.oE
.PP
This display is identical to that produced by the \*Lfolders\*O command.
See \*Lfolders\*O(1) for an explanation of this display.
.PP
The next example shows how to use \*Lfolder\*O to create an empty folder:
.oS
% \f(CBfolder +test\f(CW
Create folder "$HOME/Mail/test"? \f(CBy\f(CW
          test+ has no messages.
.oE
.PP
You can also use \*Lfolder\*O to create an empty sub-folder within an
existing folder. The following example shows how you can create a
sub-folder in the folder \*L+test\*O:
.oS
% \f(CBfolder +test/testtwo\f(CW
Create folder "$HOME/Mail/test/testwo"? \f(CBy\f(CW
          test/testtwo+ has no messages.
.oE
See \*Lrefile\*O(1) for more details of sub-folders.
