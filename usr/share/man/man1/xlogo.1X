.SH NAME
xlogo - X Window System logo
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xlogo
[-\f2toolkitoption\fP ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f2xlogo\fP program displays the X Window System logo.  This program is
nothing more than a wrapper around the \f2undocumented\fP Athena Logo widget.
.SH OPTIONS
.I Xlogo
accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options, as well as the
following:
.TP 8
.B \-shape
This option indicates that the logo window should be shaped rather than
rectangular.
.SH RESOURCES
The default width and the default height are each 100 pixels.
This program uses the \f2Logo\fP widget in the Athena widget set.  It
understands all of the Simple widget resource names and classes as well as:
.TP 8
.B foreground (\fPclass\f3 Foreground)
Specifies the color for the logo.  The default is depends on whether
\f2reverseVideo\fP is specified.  If \f2reverseVideo\fP is specified
the default is \f2XtDefaultForeground\fP, otherwise the default is 
\f2XtDefaultBackground\fP.
.TP 8
.B shapeWindow (\fPclass\f3 ShapeWindow) 
Specifies that the window is shaped to the X logo.  The default is False.
.SH WIDGETS
In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of
the widgets which compose \f2xlogo\f1.  In the notation below,
indentation indicates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name
is given first, followed by the widget instance name.
