.SH NAME
mh \- introduction to MH
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.iX "mh summary"
.iX "MH overview"
MH is the name of a powerful message handling system.
Rather than being a single comprehensive program,
MH consists of a collection of fairly simple
single-purpose programs to send, receive, save,
and retrieve messages.
Refer to the individual MH reference pages for
descriptions of the programs that make up MH.
.PP
Unlike \*Lmail\*O, MH is not a closed system which must be explicitly run,
and then exited when you wish to return to the shell.
Instead, you may freely intersperse
MH commands with other shell commands.
This allows you to read and answer your mail
while you have (for example) a compilation running,
or are searching for a file or running programs
to find an answer to someone's question before replying to them.
.PP
To get started using MH,
add the directory \*L/usr/bin/mh\*O to your \*L$PATH\*O.
This is best done in one of the files \*L\&.profile\*O, \*L\&.login\*O, or
\*L\&.cshrc\*O in your home directory.
Check the manual entry for the shell you use
if you do not know how to do this.
Run the \*Linc\*O command.
If you
have never used MH before,
it creates the necessary default files and directories
after asking you if you wish it to do so.
The \*Linc\*O command moves mail from your system maildrop into your
MH \*L+inbox\*O folder.
Each message is converted to MH format,
and stored as separate files in your \*L+inbox\*O folder
until you have read it.
When you have read a message,
you can refile it in another folder that you have created.
.PP
Folders are directories in which messages are stored:
the folders themselves are stored in your Mail directory.
See \*Lrefile\*O(1) and \*Lfolder\*O(1) for more details.
.PP
For each message it processes, \*Linc\*O prints a one-line display.
The one-line display
contains the \*LFrom:\*O field, the \*LSubject:\*O field,
and as much of the first line of the message as it can accommodate.
The first message that \*Linc\*O processes becomes your current message.
All MH commands operate on the current message
unless you have specified the
\*Vmsg\*O
argument.
.PP
You
need to run \*Linc\*O each time you wish to incorporate new mail
into your \*L+inbox\*O folder.
.PP
The \*Lscan\*O command prints a list of the messages in your current folder.
.PP
The commands \*Lshow\*O, \*Lnext\*O, and \*Lprev\*O are
used to read specific messages from the current folder.
Of these, \*Lshow\*O displays the current message.
You can also display a specific message by specifying its number.
In the following example, the mail system displays
the contents of message number 10 in the current folder:
.oS
% \f(CBshow 10
.oE
.PP
The commands \*Lnext\*O and \*Lprev\*O display
the message numerically following
and numerically preceding the current message, respectively.
In all cases, the message displayed becomes the current message.
If there is no current message, \*Lshow\*O may be called with an argument,
or \*Lnext\*O may be used to advance to the first message.
The command \*Lrmm\*O (remove message) deletes the current message.
.PP
You can delete messages other than the current message by specifying the
message number or numbers.
When you specify more than one message,
you separate each message number by a space.
In the following example, messages 2, 4 and 6
in the current folder are deleted:
.oS
% \f(CBrmm 2 4 6
.oE
.PP
The command \*Lrepl\*O is used to reply to a message.
It places you in the editor with a prototype response form.
While you are in the editor,
you may view the item you are responding to by reading the file \*L@\*O.
.PP
The \*Lcomp\*O command allows you to compose a
message by putting you in the editor on
a blank message header form,
and then lets you send it.
.PP
All the MH commands may be run with the single argument
.BR \-help ,
which causes them to print a list of the arguments
with which they may be invoked.
.PP
Commands which take a message number as an argument
(\c \*Lscan\*O, \*Lshow\*O, \*Lrepl\*O, for example)
also take one of the following keywords:
.\"
.TP 10
\*Lfirst\*O
The first message in the current folder.
.\"
.TP
\*Llast\*O
The last message in the current folder.
.\"
.TP
\*Lcur\*O
The current message in the current folder.
.\"
.TP
\*Lprev\*O
The previous message in the current folder.
.\"
.TP
\*Lnext\*O
The next message in the current folder.
.\"
.PP
Commands
which take a range of message numbers, such as \*Lrmm\*O, \*Lscan\*O, or
\*Lshow\*O, also take any of the following abbreviations:
.\"
.TP 10
\*Vnum1\*L-\f2num2\*O
Indicates all messages in the range \f2num1\f1 to \f2num2\f1, inclusive.
The specified range must contain at least one message.
.\"
.IP \*Vnum\*L:+\f2n\*O
.PD 0
.IP \*Vnum\*L:-\f2n\*O
.PD
Up to \f2n\f1 messages beginning with (or ending with) message \f2num\f1.
The value of \f2num\f1 may be any of the MH message keywords: \*Lfirst\*O,
\*Lprev\*O, \*Lcur\*O, \*Lnext\*O or \*Llast\*O.
.\"
.IP \*Lfirst:\*Vn\*O
.PD 0
.IP \*Lprev:\*Vn\*O
.PD 0
.IP \*Lnext:\*Vn\*O
.PD 0
.IP \*Llast:\*Vn\*O
.PD
The first, previous, next or last \f2n\f1 messages, if they exist.
.\"
.PP
There are many other possibilities,
such as creating multiple folders for different topics,
and automatically refiling messages according to subject,
source, destination, or content.
See the individual reference pages for more details
of the rest of the MH commands.
