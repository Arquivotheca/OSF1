.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.iX "whom command"
.iX "listing addressees on a message"
The \*Lwhom\*O command is used to expand the headers of a
message into a set of addresses,
and optionally to verify that those
addresses are deliverable at that time
if
.B \-check
is given.
.PP
The \*Lwhom\*O command is often invoked as one of the options
offered by the \*L whatnow program
when you have finished editing a draft message.
See \*Lwhatnow\*O(1) for more details.
.\"
.\" ***Info from old Arguments section
.\"
.PP
If you want to run \*Lwhom\*O on a named file,
you can supply a
\*Vfile\*O
argument.
This argument allows you to specify a named file;
if you want to run \*Lwhom\*O on an existing message, use the
.B \-draftfolder
and
.B \-draftmessage
options.
If you do not give an absolute pathname (one beginning with
a / or \&./ or \&.\&./ ), \*Lwhom\*O assumes
that the named file is in your current
working directory.

.SH FLAGS
.PP
.IP "\-alias \f2aliasfile\f1" 10
Specifies the alias file to be consulted by \*Lwhom\*O. If
you have used one or more aliases in your
message header, \*Lwhom\*O will consult the named file to find those aliases,
and will print the full addresses as its output.
You can reference more than one file,
but each file name must be preceded by the word \f3\-alias\f1.
See \*Lmh-alias\*O(4) for more information.
.\"
.\"
.IP \-check
.PD 0
.IP \-nocheck
.PD
Checks that the addresses are valid. \*Lwhom\*O makes
no guarantees that the addresses
listed as being correct are really deliverable:
rather, an address being listed
as correct
means that at the time that \*Lwhom\*O was run, the address was
thought to be deliverable
by the transport service.
For local addresses, this means that the local user
does exist, and that the address was deliverable at the
time of checking.
For network
.\" X.400
and uucp addresses, it means that the
syntax of the address is valid.
.\"
.\"
.IP \-draft
Sets the draft message to be the standard
file \*Ldraft\*O in your Mail directory.
.\"
.\"
.IP "\-draftfolder\ \f2folder" 10
.PD 0
.IP \-nodraftfolder 10
.PD
Specifies the folder in which \*Lwhom\*O searches for the draft message.
The default is to use the current message in the named folder.
You can select another message by using the
.B \-draftmessage
option.
For more information on using a draft folder, see \*Lcomp\*O(1). The
.B \-draftfolder
option is often set up in your user profile;
see \*Lmh_profile\*O(4) for more information.
.\"
.\"
.IP \-draftmessage\ \f2msg\f1
Specifies the draft message to be used.
If you specify a folder with the
.B \-draftfolder
option, the
.B \-draftmessage
option takes the number of a message in that folder.
If you do not specify a folder,
.B \-draftmessage
takes the name of a file.
If you do not give an absolute pathname (one beginning with
a / or \&./ or \&.\&./ ),
.B \-draftmessage
assumes that the file is located in your Mail directory.
.\"
.\"
.IP \-help
Prints a list of the valid options to this command.
.\"
.\"
.\"
.\" ***COMMENTED OUT
.ig
.IP \-mts\ \f2mtsname\f1
Indicates whether addresses to be checked are
X.400 or non-X.400 addresses.
The
.B \-mts
option takes one of two values:
.B "\-mts x400"
checks that addresses are in a valid format for
transport over the X.400 system;
.B "\-mts smtp"
checks that the addresses are deliverable to
non-X.400 users.
You can use upper- or lower-case letters,
or a combination of the two.
If the draft mail message contains an entry in
the \*LX-mts:\*O header field, this overrides any
.B \-mts
option in the command line.
If no
.B \-mts
option
or \*LX-mts:\*O field is specified,
the default is to assume non-X.400 addresses.
See \*Lcomp\*O(1) for more information.
..
.\" ***END OF COMMENTS
.\"
.\"
.IP "\-mts smtp"
Specifies the format of the addresses to be checked.
The only value allowed is \f3smtp\f1,
which checks that addresses are deliverable over
the standard mail system.
Additional values are supported only for use with other
mail systems.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
In the following example, \*Lwhom\*O would use the
current message in the \*L+drafts\*O folder:
.oS
% \f(CBwhom \-draftfolder +drafts
\f(CW  smith: address OK
.oE
.PP
In the next example, \*Lwhom\*O searches for
message 2 in the folder \*L+drafts\*O:
.oS
% \f(CBwhom \-draftfolder +drafts \-draftmessage 2
\f(CW  davis@hostname: address OK
.oE
