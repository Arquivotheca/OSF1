.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.iX "CDA Viewer messages"
CDA Viewer messages may be reported while you are viewing a CDA
document. These messages refer to conditions that range from successful
completion of the operation to termination of processing because of a
serious error. The CDA Viewer can also return one or more CDA run-time
messages.
.PP
When viewing a CDA document on a workstation, select Diagnostic
Information... from the File pull-down menu in the CDA Viewer window to
display messages. When viewing a CDA document on a character-cell terminal,
CDA Viewer and run-time messages appear on your screen by default.
.PP
CDA Viewer messages consist of a message number and message text.
.PP
The following section lists the CDA Viewer messages. A brief explanation
and recommended user action follows each message, unless a user action is
not required. The messages are listed in alphabetical order, by message
name.
.SH CDA VIEWER MESSAGES
.PP
56328201, NORMAL, normal completion
.br
\f3Level:\f1 Success
.br
\f3Explanation:\f1 Routine completed as expected.
.sp
.PP
56328219, NOFONT, cannot load font
.br
\f3Level:\f1 Informational
.br
\f3Explanation:\f1 The CDA Viewer could not load a specified font. If an
application created a DDIF file specifying a font that
does not exist on the X server, the CDA Viewer will use a
default font (12 point Courier) when trying to view this file.
.br
\f3User Action:\f1 If you are using the CDA Viewer application, check for
diagnostic error messages in the CDA Viewer's Diagnostic
Information dialog box.
.sp
If you are using the DVR
callable widget interface, specify a callback to a viewer
widget instance and look for DvrCRcdaError callback
reasons in your callback procedure.
The DvrCRcdaError callback reasons should specify
which font the CDA Viewer cannot find.
Determine where the DDIF file was originally created so that
you can check for an X server, which may contain the
specified font.
.sp
.PP
56328227, TOPOFDOC, attempt to move past beginning of document
.br
\f3Level:\f1 Informational
.br
\f3Explanation:\f1 The top of a document has been reached.
Attempts to move backward in a given document will not be successful.
.sp
.PP
56328243, EOD, end of document
.br
\f3Level:\f1 Informational
.br
\f3Explanation:\f1 The end of a document has been reached.
Attempts to move forward in a given document will not be successful.
.sp
.PP
56328267, DEFAULTFONT, default font
.br
\f3Level:\f1 Informational
.br
\f3Explanation:\f1 The CDA Viewer was unable to load a specified font, so it
has defaulted to using a fallback font (12 point Courier).
.br
\f3User Action:\f1 If you are using the CDA Viewer application, check for
diagnostic error messages in the CDA Viewer's Diagnostic
Information dialog box.
.sp
If you are using the DVR
callable widget interface, specify a callback to a viewer
widget instance and look for DvrCRcdaError callback
reasons in your callback procedure.  The DvrCRcdaError callback reasons
should specify which font the CDA Viewer cannot find.
Determine where the DDIF file was originally created so that you
can check for an X server, which may contain the
specified font.
.sp
.PP
56328283, NODISPCONT, no displayable content
.br
\f3Level:\f1 Informational
.br
\f3Explanation:\f1 The DDIF document does not contain any displayable content.
.br
\f3User Action:\f1 If you are using the character-cell CDA Viewer, try converting the
file to PostScript output, or view the file with the
windowing CDA Viewer to check whether there is content
in the document which cannot be displayed on a
character-cell device.
.sp
If you are using the windowing CDA Viewer,
check the content of the DDIF document using the Analysis back end
or the application that created the file, or check with the creator of
the document to find an appropriate method of viewing the
file.
.sp
.PP

you must call the DvrViewerFile() routine before calling
the DvrNextPage() routine.
.br
\f3User Action:\f1 Ensure that you have called the necessary routines to
open a file before trying to manipulate it.
.sp
.PP
56328299, OPENFAIL, file cannot be opened
.br
\f3Level:\f1 Severe
