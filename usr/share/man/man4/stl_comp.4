.SH NAME
\*Lstl_comp\*O \- setld subset compression flag files
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.iX "kits" "subset compression flag file format"
.iX "setld" "subset compression flag file format"
Each software subset that is distributed for the
\*Lsetld\*O(8)
command can have an associated
\*Vcompression flag\*O
file.  This optional empty file is created by the
\*Lkits\*O(1)
utility for a product kit if the COMPRESS
attribute is set in the product's key file.  The compression flag
file's name consists of the subset name with the string
\*L\&.comp\*O
for a suffix.  The presence of a compression flag file for a given
product indicates to the
\*Lsetld\*O
utility that the subsets were compressed by
\*Lkits\*O
when the product kit was created.
