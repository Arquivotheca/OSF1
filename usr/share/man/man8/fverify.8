.SH NAME
\*Lfverify\*O \- verify software subsets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\*L/usr/lbin/fverify\*O [ \*L\-yn\*O ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.iX "fverify command"
.iX "setld" "verify software subsets"
.iX "software subset" "verifying"
The
\*Lfverify\*O
command reads subset inventory records from standard input and verifies
that the attributes for the files on the system match the attributes
listed in the corresponding records.  Invoking
\*Lfverify\*O
with no flags causes it to report errors to the standard output and
prompt the user for confirmation before making corrections.
.PP
Missing files and inconsistencies in file size, checksum, user id,
group id, permissions, and file type are reported.  If inconsistencies
in user id, group id, or permissions are detected,
\*Lfverify\*O
asks if they are to be corrected.  If a missing file is a directory, it
is created.  All errors and informational messages are logged to the
\*L/var/adm/smlogs/fverify.log\*O
file.
.PP
Files in a subset can be marked as volatile.  These files (for example,
\*L/etc/passwd\*O)
are expected to change after installation.  When used
with the
.B \-p
flag,
\*Lfverify\*O
does not complain if these files have a size or checksum that does not
match the product's inventory.
.PP
The
\*Lsetld\*O
utility uses
\*Lfverify\*O
when installing subsets to guarantee correct installation.
.SH FLAGS
.PP
.TP
.B \-n
Specifies error reporting only.  The
\*Lfverify\*O
command reports errors and does not perform any fixes.
.TP
.B \-p
Specifies partial checking.  The
\*Lfverify\*O
command does not report changes in size or checksum on files that are
marked as volatile.  All other changes, including uid, gid,
permissions, and file tyuupe, are reported.
.TP
.B \-y
Specifies noninteractive fixing.  The
\*Lfverify\*O
command fixes permissions, uids, and gids on any files which have
incorrect values for these attributes.  No user input is required.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
Problems with file size, file type, and file checksum cannot be
corrected.  Verification errors on permissions for symbolic links are
neither reported nor fixed.
.PP
Because the subset inventories give file names as relative paths,
\*Lfverify\*O
must be in the root directory to which the software is installed.
.PP
Many of the files on the system cannot be read or modified without
appropriate privilege.  Attempting to run
\*Lfverify\*O
without appropriate privilege may result in a great number of access
errors.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following command sequence reports verification problems in the
hypothetical OATDCB100 subset:
.oS
cd /
.nL
/usr/lbin/fverify -n < /usr/.smdb./OATDCB100.inv
.oE
.PP
The previous example reports changes to volatile files.  The following
command sequence ignores changes to these files:
.oS
cd /
.nL
/usr/lbin/fverify -np < /usr/.smdb./OATDCB100.inv
.oE
.PP
The following command sequence fixes all problems in the same subset
without requiring user intervention:
.oS
cd /
.nL
/usr/lbin/fverify -y < /usr/.smdb./OATDCB100.inv
.oE
.PP
The following command sequence fixes all problems in the same subset
interactively:
.oS
cd /
.nL
/usr/lbin/fverify < /usr/.smdb./OATDCB100.inv
.oE
.SH ERRORS
.PP
.B fverify: out of memory
.br
.RS 5
Not enough memory is available from the system.
.RE
.PP
.IB pathname ": cannot stat (" error-message )
.br
.RS 5
The file
\*Vpathname\*O
is listed in the inventory but is not on the system.
The
\*Verror-message\*O
explains why.
.RE
.PP
.IB pathname ": file type " x " should be " y
.br
.RS 5
The file is listed in the inventory as being of type
\*Vy\*O,
but the copy of the file on the disk is type
\*Vx\*O.
The file type codes are:
.IP b 5
Block device
.IP c 5
Character device
.IP d 5
Directory containing one or more files
.IP f 5
Regular file
.IP l 5
Hard link
.IP p 5
Named pipe (FIFO)
.IP s 5
Symbolic link
.IP = 5
UNIX domain socket
.RE
.PP
.IB pathname ": checksum " n " should be "  m
.br
.RS 5
There is a checksum error on
\*Vpathname\*O.
The values
\*Vn\*O
and
\*Vm\*O
are the actual and expected values.
.RE
.PP
.IB pathname ": size " n " should be " m
.br
.RS 5
The size of file
\*Vpathname\*O
is not as expected. The numbers
\*Vn\*O
and
\*Vm\*O
are the actual and expected values.
.RE
.PP
.IB pathname ": gid " n " should be " m
.br
.RS 5
The group id for
\*Vpathname\*O
is not as expected. The group ids
\*Vn\*O
and
\*Vm\*O
are the actual and expected values.
.RE
.PP
.IB pathname ": uid " n " should be " m
.br
.RS 5
The user id for
\*Vpathname\*O
is not as expected. The user ids
\*Vn\*O
and
\*Vm\*O
are the actual and expected values.
.RE
.PP
.IB pathname ": permissions " string1 " should be " string2
.br
.RS 5
The permissions for
\*Vpathname\*O
are not as expected.
\*VString1\*O
and
\*Vstring2\*O
are the actual and expected permissions.  The format of
\*Vstring1\*O
and
\*Vstring2\*O
is the same as that used by the
\*Lls\*O
command.
.RE
.PP
.BI "Creating directory " pathname
.br
.RS 5
The directory
\*Vpathname\*O
is listed in the input inventory but does not exist on the system.
The
\*Lfverify\*O
command will attempt to create the directory.
.RE
.PP
.IB "cannot correct " pathname " (" error-message )
.br
.RS 5
A problem reported with
\*Vpathname\*O
could not be corrected. The
\*Verror-message\*O
explains why.
.RE
.PP
.BI "pathname " corrected
.br
.RS 5
A problem with
.B pathname
was successfully corrected.
.RE
.PP
.BI "Cannot create dir " pathname " (" error-message )
.br
.RS 5
The
\*Lfverify\*O
program could not create a directory it was attempting to create.
The accompanying
\*Verror-message\*O
explains why.
.RE
.PP
.IB n " verification errors encountered."
.br
.RS 5
.IB m " corrections performed."
.br
.RS 5
Before exiting, the
\*Lfverify\*O
program prints these statistics describing what had been done.
.sp
.RE
.PP
If
\*Lfverify\*O
executes correctly, its exit status is the total number of verification
errors detected minus the total number of successful fixes.
