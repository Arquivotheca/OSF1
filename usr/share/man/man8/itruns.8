.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
\*Litruns\*O
program sets up scripts to be run by
\*Lit\*O(8).
(These programs are typically used within system configuration and
installation scripts.)  The
\*Litruns\*O
command searches for
\*L/sbin/it.d/bin/\*O\*Vfile\*O.
If
\*Litruns\*O
finds the file, it creates one or more symbolic links from
\*L/sbin/it.d/\*O\*Vrun-state\*O.d/\*Vfile\*O
to
\*L/sbin/it.d/bin/\*O\*Vfile\*O.
.PP
The
\*Vrun-state\*O
argument can be a single run state, or it can be two run states
separated by either the word
\*Lor\*O
or the word
\*Land\*O.
If two run states are specified with the
\*Lor\*O
keyword,
\*Litruns\*O
checks for (and creates, if necessary) a directory whose name combines
both run states and places a link in that directory so that the file
will be executed when the
\*Lit\*O
program detects either state.  You can collapse two
\*Lor\*O-separated states into a single expression; for example,
\*L2 or 3\*O
can be expressed as
\*L23\*O.
If the
\*Land\*O
keyword is used,
\*Litruns\*O
checks for (and creates, if necessary) two separate directories and
places a link in each of them so that either state triggers execution
of the file independently of the other state.
.PP
If two or more files are specified for a single
\*Vrun-state\*O
argument, links are created for all of the files as
indicated by the
\*Lrun-state\*O
argument.
.PP
If two or more combinations of files and run states are specified as
comma-separated expressions,
\*Litruns\*O
treats each combination individually.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.PP
The
\*Litruns\*O
command must be executed from the root directory
(\|\*L/\*O\|).
The command finds only files that are located in the
\*L/sbin/it.d/bin\*O
directory.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
.AL
.LI
This example sets up the
\*Ldoconfig\*O
script to be run when the system is booted to run state 2:
.oS
\*Litruns doconfig in 2\*O
.oE
.LI
Either of the command lines in this example sets up the
\*Ldoconfig\*O
and
\*Lgetdate\*O
scripts to be run when the system is booted to run state 2 or to run
state 3:
.oS
\*Litruns doconfig getdate in 2 or 3\*O
\*Litruns doconfig getdate in 23\*O
.oE
.LI
This example sets up the
\*Ldoconfig\*O
script to be run when the system is booted to run state 2 and again
when the system comes to run state 3, the
\*Lgetdate\*O
script to be run only in run state 2, and the
\*Lgetsysname\*O
script to be run only in run state 3:
.oS
\*Litruns doconfig in 2 and 3, getdate in 2, getsysname in 3\*O
.oE
