\*Lfta\*O - DEFTA FDDI Network Interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.iX "FDDI interface" "DEFTA"
.iX "DEFTA FDDI network interface"
.sS
\*Ldevice fta0 at * vector ftaintr\*O
.sE
.PP
This is the entry in the configuration file.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \*Lfta\*O interface is a high-speed TURBOchannel adapter to a 100 megabit
per second Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) timed token ring network
adapter.  The \*Lfta\*O interface allows the host system to be an FDDI single
attachment station.
.PP
The DEFTA uses DMA transfers for both transmitted and received data. The driver
initializes the DMA engine before placing the adapter on the ring.
.PP
The DEFTA can operate in full duplex mode.  To allow the \*Lfta\*O interface
operate in full duplex mode, connect two DEFTA adapters back-to-back.  The full
duplex mode is enabled or disabled by using the \*Lfddi_config\*O command.
.PP
The host's Internet address is specified at boot time with an SIOCSIFADDR
ioctl.  The \*Lfta\*O interface employs the address resolution protocol
described in \*Larp\*O(7) to map dynamically between Internet and physical
addresses on the FDDI ring.
.PP
The maximum frame size for the \*Lfta\*O interface is 4500 bytes, which is
substantially larger that the 1500 bytes maximum packet size of the Ethernet
interfaces. The \*Lfta\*O interface does not support the BSD trailer
encapsulation, which is specific to the VAX architecture.
.PP
The SIOCRPHYSADDR ioctl can be used to read the physical address of the
DEFTA adapter. The physical address of the DEFTA adapter can be
changed by use of the SIOCSPHYSADDR ioctl.
.PP
The SIOCADDMULTI and SIOCDELMULTI ioctls can be used to add or delete
multicast addresses. The DEFTA supports up to 62 multicast addresses.
.PP
The SIOCRDCTRS ioctl can be used to read the FDDI driver counters.  The
DEFTA adapter status and characteristics can also be read through this
ioctl by providing one of the following flags: FDDI_STATUS, CTR_FDDI,
FDDIMIB_PATH, FDDIMIB_SMT, FDDIMIB_MAC, FDDIMIB_PORT, and FDDIMIB_ATTA.  The
argument to this ioctl is a pointer to a counter or status structure,
\*Lctrreq\*O, found in \*L<net/if.h>\*O.
.PP
The SIOCENABLBACK and SIOCDISABLBACK ioctls can be used to enable and
disable the interface loopback mode, respectively. The driver enables internal
loopback only.
.PP
The SIOCIFRESET ioctl can be used to reset the adapter.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
To obtain the physical address of the adapter, use the SIOCRPHYSADDR
ioctl as in the following program example:
.oS
#include <stdio.h>              /* standard I/O */
#include <errno.h>              /* error numbers */
#include <sys/socket.h>         /* socket definitions */
#include <sys/ioctl.h>          /* ioctls */
#include <net/if.h>             /* generic interface structures */

main()
{
  int s,i;
  static   struct  ifdevea  devea;
  /* Get a socket */
  s = socket(AF_INET,SOCK_DGRAM,0);
  if (s < 0) {
     perror("socket");
     exit(1);
  }
  strcpy(devea.ifr_name,"fta0");
  if (ioctl(s,SIOCRPHYSADDR,&devea) < 0) {
     perror(&devea.ifr_name[0]);
     exit(1);
  }
  printf(Address is ");
  for (i = 0, i < 6, i++)
     printf("%X ", devea.default_pa[1] & 0xff);
  printf("\n");
  close(s);
}
.oE
.PP
To reset the adapter, use the SIOCIFRESET ioctl as in the following program
example:
.oS
#include <stdio.h>              /* standard I/O */
#include <errno.h>              /* error numbers */
#include <sys/socket.h>         /* socket definitions */
#include <sys/ioctl.h>          /* ioctls */
#include <net/if.h>             /* generic interface structures */

main()
{
  int s;
  struct  ifreq  data;
  /* Get a socket */
  s = socket(AF_INET,SOCK_DGRAM,0);
  if (s < 0) {
     perror("socket");
     exit(1);
  }
  strcpy(data.ifr,"fta0");
  if (ioctl(s,SIOCIFRESET,&data) < 0) {
     perror("SIOCIFRESET:");
     exit(1);
  }
  close(s);
}

.SH ERRORS
.PP
Diagnostic messages contain information provided by the \*Lfta\*O
driver and the adapter. The following messages contain information about the
adapter's state, and are printed on the console, where \*Vn\*O
is an message number:
.VL
.LI "fta\*Vn\*O: Reset"
.LI "fta\*Vn\*O: Upgrade"
.LI "fta\*Vn\*O: DMA Unavailable"
.LI "fta\*Vn\*O: DMA Available"
.LI "fta\*Vn\*O: Link Available"
.LI "fta\*Vn\*O: Link Unavailable"
.LI "fta\*Vn\*O: Halted"
.LE
.PP
Once in the DMA Available state, the adapter goes to the
Link Unavailable state and finally to the Link Available state.
.PP
The following messages contain information about adapter events:
.VL
.LI "fta\*Vn\*O: Directed beacon received"
The DEFTA has received a directed beacon.
