Incompatible function declarations for %s
For two function types to be compatible, both shall specify compatible
return types. Moreover, the parameter type lists, if both are present,
shall agree in the number of parameters and in use of the ellipsis
terminator; corresponding parameters shall have compatible types. If
one type has a parameter type list and the other type is specified by
a function declarator that is not part of a function definition and
contains an empty identifier list, the parameter list shall not have 
an ellipsis terminator and the type of each parameter shall be 
compatible with they type that results from application of the default
argument promotions. If one type has a parameter type list and the 
other is specified by a function definition that contains a (possibly
empty) identifier list, both shall agree in the number of parameters,
and the type of each prototype parameter shall be compatible with the
type that results from application of the default argument promotions
to the type of the corresponding identifier. (For each parameter
declared with function or array type, its type for these comparisons
is the one that results from conversion to a pointer type. For each
parameter declared with qualified type, its type for these comparions
is the unqualified version of its declared type.) There you have it!

'%s' type is incomplete; cannot initialize
was struct ever defined?
3.5.7.(31)
'%s' is not standard ANSI.
This keyword/type is not defined in strict ANSI mode.
3.1.1
not a legal asm string
The first operand of an asm string should be, after argument substitution,
a legal assembly string.
ANSI C support unavailable with C compiler bundled with RISC/os
The C compiler bundled with RISC/os does not support ANSI C. ANSI
C support requires a separate license
'%s' not handled as an intrinsic due to incompatible argument types .
'__unalign' only qualifies pointers
'__unalign' indicates the object pointed at by pointer is unaligned, e.g.
int * __unalign p. This is an extension to ANSI C and like 'volatile'
and 'const' can follow the '*' in pointer declarations, but unlike both
cannot qualify a base type.
index expression is an anachronism
ANSI C++ doesn't support array index expressions in delete
5.3.4
member types cannot be function types or incomplete type.
3.5.2.1(27)
cannot open header message buffer file
cannot write header message buffer file
cannot read header message buffer file
cannot seek in header message buffer file
struct/union '%s' never defined
static '%s' unused
nonportable character comparison
comparison of unsigned with negative constant
comparison of unsigned with 0?
degenerate unsigned comparison
'%s' may be used before set
argument '%s' unused in function '%s'
'%s' unused in function '%s'
'%s' set but unused in function '%s'
function '%s' has return(e); and return;
main() returns random value to invocation environment
label without goto: '%s'
conversion to long may sign-extend incorrectly
conversion from long may lose accuracy
'%s' may be indistinguishable from '%s' due to internal name truncation
possible pointer alignment problem
       (as included in %s)
==============
unsupported language linkage
string-literal specifies an unsupported linkage
7.4(1)
No prototype for the call to %s
To achieve better type-checking, there should be a full prototype for
the function being called.
3.5.4.3
'inline' only applies to function declarations
leave statment can occur only within try body
Microsoft extension
Use of a Microsoft extension detected without enabling them with
compiler option -msft
Second arg in __builtin_va_start must be param
The second argument in va_start builtin must have 'parameter' storage class
Third arg in __builtin_va_start must be int/long constant
The Third arg in __builtin_va_start must be integer or long constant type
Arg count wrong for __builtin_va_start
The maximum number of arguments to __builtin_va_start is restricted to 3
The value of the pointer in this static initialization has been truncated
The value of the 64 bit pointer in this static initialization has been
truncated to 32 bits.  Consider using the -taso switch.
Definition for incompletely typed object %s never found.
A corresponding definition for this object reference was not found.
A denormalized value was encountered by the compiler.  Use -Wf,-denorm switch to truncate value to zero
A denormalized value was encountered by the compiler.  Use -Wf,-denorm switch to truncate value to zero
A denormalized value was encountered by the compiler.  Value truncated to zero
A denormalized value was encountered by the compiler.  Value truncated to zero

The -float_const switch is not valid in strict ANSI mode and will be ignored
The -float_const switch is not valid in strict ANSI mode and will be ignored. ANSI requires that floats be treated as doubles unless suffexed. Extend ANSI mode allows this.
%s:%s: Backslash new-line at end of file
2.1.1.2(31)
Cannot convert a pointer to the destination type.
This initialization involves conversion of a pointer to a type whose size
is less than 32 bits.  Such an initialization requires a relocation that is
not supported.
%s is of type VOID and may not be initialized
%s is of type VOID and may not be initialized
This initialization is unsupported.
This initialization requires a sign extending relocation that is not supported.
Consider using the -taso switch.
%s:%s: Constant out of range
The constant is too large to fit in the data type.  The limits are in
the system include file limits.h.  The value may be truncated.
2.2.4.2
The -long_double_const switch is not valid in strict ANSI mode and will be ignored
The -long_double_const switch is not valid in strict ANSI mode and will be ignored. ANSI requires that floats be treated as doubles unless suffexed. Extend ANSI mode allows this.
Invalid initialization of a bitfield
Bitfields may only be initialized with compile-time constants.
